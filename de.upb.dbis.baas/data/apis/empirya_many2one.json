Despite this shift in consumer sentiment, the research revealed consumers are not taking necessary precautions to protect their personal information. When asked what measures they are implementing to better safeguard their information online, the majority (76 percent) of respondents said they had merely implemented stronger passwords \\u2014 a step that is typically required when setting up an online account. A significant 20 percent said they aren\\u2019t doing anything at all. It is no question the cyber threat environment remains dynamic and dangerous, and is gaining in severity. According to a recent report released by the Identity Theft Resource Center (ITRC), companies in the U.S. experienced a record-breaking 783 data breaches in 2014.\\u00a0Already in 2015 this trend has continued with the Anthem Health security breach \\u2014 the largest in history, affecting more than 80 million of its customers, as well as Sony, TV Monde and others.\\u00a0Many of these attacks were initiated by sophisticated hackers looking for ways to circumvent perimeter defenses through compromised devices, while others originated from within the network through unsuspecting employees or partners who, without malicious intent, let cyber criminals in. \\u201cThe amount of entry points cyber criminals can use to infiltrate corporate networks and steal precious information is growing rapidly, as the number of devices connected to the network increase,\\u201d said Andrew Del Matto, chief financial officer at Fortinet. \\u201cIf consumers aren\\u2019t taking precautions to protect their devices and proprietary data in their personal lives, it is unlikely they are doing so at work, increasing the possibility of a breach. It is more critical now than ever before for businesses to help safeguard the consumer and customer data for which they are responsible. They must take a multi-layered approach to security to protect against both malicious and non-malicious threats, from both inside and outside of the network.\\u201d Most Consumers Trust No One When It Comes to Protecting Personal InformationOn a scale of one-to-five with one being \\u201ccompletely \\u2026.. \\nRead the full article: http:\\/\\/money.cnn.com\\/news\\/newsfeeds\\/articles\\/marketwire\\/11G038880-001.htm (only 1\\/3 of the full article is shown) \\u00a0&#13;\\n&#13;\\nPlease note: SentiRate is not responsible for the accuracy, legality, decency of material or copyright compliance of any Linked Site or services or information provided via any Linked Site.

It is far from the UK, almost in Africa, but by dint of history \\u2013 initially in the Treaty of Utrecht but through many subsequent agreements, reluctant or otherwise\\u2013 it has been British for 300 years. Strategically important during the Second World War, it has now become economically very important to a lot of companies.\\n\\n\\tIt has become an epicentre of the electronic gambling industry, with almost 30 companies licensed to operate there. It is home to a large number of financial services and shipping companies. This has undoubtedly been influenced by its low tax regime; but don\\u2019t fall for the hype \\u2013 it is a rigorously enforced regime, compliant with more European directives than many of its neighbours.\\n\\n\\tIts location means it is a natural gateway both to Europe and to Africa. These may be among the factors apparently insulating it from the world\\u2019s economic downturn, through which it continued to grow albeit at a slower rate than before. It\\u2019s growing its software industry and angling its tourism to ensure longer visits from people at different times of the year. It\\u2019s tiny allright \\u2013 but its prospects have never been so.\\n\\n\\tDownload the PDF here. \\n     &#13;\\n  &#13;\\n&#13;\\n&#13;\\n&#13;\\n&#13;\\n&#13;\\n  \\n  \\n    &#13;\\n            \\n\\t\\n\\n\\tBring Your Own Device \\n\\n\\tHow mobile technology is revolutionising the workplace.\\n\\n\\tHow are you reading this web page?

As part of the wider economy it employs 2,000 people. From a total population of 30,000 this is significant.\\n\\n\\n\\t\\tThose employees mostly live on the Rock and they in turn fuel the other parts of the economy. They buy and rent homes, they shop, they use transport.\\u00a0\\n\\n\\t\\t\\u00a0\\n\\n\\t\\tIt\\u2019s not just the people either - e-gaming has started pulling through other industries in its wake. One thing utterly crucial in a regulated environment like gambling is a completely robust technical infrastructure. Gibtelecom has built a powerful communications network partly because the gaming industry has demanded it - and it\\u2019s now solid enough for financial services to reside on it.\\u00a0\\n\\n\\t\\t\\u00a0\\n\\n\\t\\tE-gaming used to happen only on desktop computers. In recent years there has been a proliferation of smartphones and tablets, resulting in a fledgeling software design industry around the e-gaming partners on the rock. The industry is actually a powerful catalyst for a great deal else - \\u00a0this supplement explores how it works.\\n\\n\\n\\t07 October 2013\\n\\n     &#13;\\n  &#13;\\n&#13;\\n&#13;\\n&#13;\\n&#13;\\n&#13;\\n  \\n  \\n    &#13;\\n            \\n\\n\\t\\t\\n\\n\\t\\t\\u00a0\\n\\n\\t\\t\\u201cMy principal argument is that after sixty years [of inaction] we really need to get on with something.\\u201d So said Graham Brady MP during a New Statesman-hosted round table debate on aviation capacity earlier this summer. Sir Roy McNulty, chairman of Gatwick Airport (our partner in putting together this supplement) agreed, describing the need as \\u201cstaringly obvious\\u201d while Adam Marshall of the British Chambers of \\u00a0Commerce talked of \\u201cmassive constraint\\u201d.\\n\\n\\t\\t\\u00a0\\n\\n\\t\\tGovernment figures suggest 35 million passengers will be left grounded every year from 2050 if the status quo remains.\\n\\n\\t\\tSo far, so consensual. But while the prognosis is broadly, if not universally, agreed, the nature of the cure divides opinion. The discussion to date has been underwritten by a series of assumptions about the future shape of air travel. Here conventional wisdom is being traded as fact and conclusions are being drawn that urgently need revisiting.\\u00a0\\n\\n\\t\\t\\u00a0\\n\\n\\t\\tAs the title of this supplement \\u2013 \\u201cRethinking the debate on aviation capacity\\u201d \\u2013 suggests, these pages are an attempt to challenge some of those assumptions. It is aimed at the expert and non-expert reader alike.\\u00a0\\n\\n\\n\\t16 September 2013\\n\\n     &#13;\\n  &#13;\\n&#13;\\n&#13;\\n&#13;\\n&#13;\\n&#13;\\n  \\n  \\n    &#13;\\n            \\n\\n\\t\\t\\n\\n\\n\\t\\t\\tThe relationship between the trade unions and the Labour party has dominated the headlines over recent months: the Falkirk selection row, the use of party funding as a means to buy influence... These issues are nothing new \\u2013 as our history essay on page 10 shows, since the beginnings of the\\n\\n\\t\\t\\trelationship in the 1900s it\\u2019s been a rocky road with frequent tiffs and accusations of bribery, misogyny and excessive influence.\\n\\n\\t\\t\\t\\u00a0\\n\\n\\t\\t\\tWhile Ed Miliband and Len McCluskey have been fighting it out on the front pages, behind the scenes much hard work has been taking place to represent members\\u2019 interests \\u2013 whether it\\u2019s fighting to save jobs and wages, supporting food banks or campaigning against draconian welfare reforms and cuts to much needed public services.\\n\\n\\t\\t\\t\\u00a0\\n\\n\\t\\t\\tHowever, little media attention has been afforded to this aspect of what unions do, thus hindering public understanding of what they achieve. Consequently the unions suffer from what could be described as an image problem. We look at what could be done to address this on page 16.\\n\\n\\t\\t\\t\\u00a0\\n\\n\\t\\t\\tAnd of course, we have our guide: detailed listings of Britain\\u2019s unions, international counterparts and other useful contacts.\\n\\n\\n\\t\\t9 September 2013\\n\\n\\n     &#13;\\n  &#13;\\n&#13;\\n&#13;\\n&#13;\\n&#13;\\n&#13;\\n  \\n  \\n    &#13;\\n            \\n\\t\\n\\n\\t\\u00a0\\n\\n\\n\\t\\tWe live in a digital world. Eighty three per cent of the UK population is online and the demand for virtual services is growing at an ever-quickening pace. So when the question \\u201cWhere is our data?\\u201d was posed at a New Statesman-hosted round table earlier in the summer, there was both a simple answer to the question and some complexities to untangle.\\n\\n\\t\\t\\u00a0\\n\\n\\t\\tThe simple answer is that most of our data is housed in data centres. To proponents, including former cabinet minister Steven Norris (see interview on page 28), data centres are the factories of the digital age. This supplement acts in part as a beginner\\u2019s guide: the schematic overleaf, explains how they work while the jargon buster on page 30 provides some essential definitions.\\n\\n\\t\\t\\u00a0\\n\\n\\t\\tThe complexity surrounds security, privacy, energy supply, power consumption and a looming skills shortage \\u2013 and these themes are addressed across the following pages. Despite the centrality of data centres to much of the nation\\u2019s cultural, social and economic activity, awareness remains limited. Government remains confused, says Norris. This supplement is a contribution to the demystification process.\\n\\n\\n\\t2 September 2013\\n\\n     &#13;\\n  &#13;\\n&#13;\\n&#13;\\n&#13;\\n&#13;\\n&#13;\\n  \\n  \\n    &#13;\\n            \\n\\t\\n\\n\\n\\t\\tTurn to page 5 of this guide and you will see an image of the infamous Edvard Munch painting, The Scream, being auctioned at Sotheby\\u2019s in May 2012. One of four versions of the painting created by Munch, it is the only one that is privately owned. It sold for more than \\u00a380m. Art as an investment is becoming increasingly popular. As too are investments in antiques, race horses, venture capital funds, real estate, jewellery, forests and other such alternative asset classes.\\n\\n\\t\\t\\u00a0\\n\\n\\t\\tThe increasing interest is, in the main, the result of economic uncertainty and investors\\u2019 desire to look beyond traditional vehicles. It could also be said that there is a growing appreciation of the value \\u2013 and satisfaction \\u2013 of turning passions into profit.\\n\\n\\t\\t\\u00a0\\n\\n\\t\\tAlternative investment strategies can be risky. They often involve putting faith into fledging companies, the need for a horse to cross a finish line first or being left at the mercy of the weather as those investing in vineyards are. However, they can also offer the opportunity to diversify, generate returns and invest in items of personal interest. What better than buying a painting to enjoy while also benefiting (one hopes) from the increasing value?\\n\\n\\n\\t5 August 2013\\n\\n     &#13;\\n  &#13;\\n&#13;\\n&#13;\\n&#13;\\n&#13;\\n&#13;\\n  \\n  \\n    &#13;\\n            \\n\\t\\n\\n\\n\\t\\tAlthough the health needs of the UK have changed dramatically since the inception of the NHS, our health-care system remains largely unchanged. This leaves us with a National Health Service that is designed to meet the needs of a society that no longer exists. There is wide agreement that the NHS needs to prioritise preventative care to take the strain off front-line services.\\n\\n\\t\\t\\u00a0\\n\\n\\t\\tIn the 20th century, before the NHS, many urban local councils started off as \\u201clocal boards of health\\u201d, then becoming district councils, and local authorities. At each stage of reorganisation these bodies lost a little bit more of their role in health until today the care they mostly deliver is adult social care and children's services; any other health care is delivered by other bodies.\\n\\n\\t\\t\\u00a0\\n\\n\\t\\tThe Health and Social Care Act has placed a large emphasis on local government driving improvements in public health with a renewed focus on prevention. With responsibility for public health having being transferred from the NHS to local government on 1 April this year, we can expect our health landscape to change quite dramatically. Local government seems to be rising to the challenge and coming up with some innovative solutions but it is difficult to see the scale of its aspiration to drive change and deliver innovative health services.\\n\\n\\t\\t\\u00a0\\n\\n\\t\\tLabour is proposing a single holistic system, integrating physical, mental and social care. To deliver this, local government would hold an integrated budget for most health and social care services \\u2013 likely to amount to about \\u00a389bn. But are local governments really capable of commissioning and delivering these ambitious plans?\\n\\n\\n\\t22 July 2013\\n\\n     &#13;\\n  &#13;\\n&#13;\\n&#13;\\n&#13;\\n&#13;\\n&#13;\\n  \\n  \\n    &#13;\\n            \\n\\t\\n\\n\\n\\t\\tEncouraging more small and medium-sized businesses (SMEs) to export is a practical rather than an abstract challenge for this country. It is a necessary outcome if the UK is going to build a new economic settlement where old assumptions about Western dominance are challenged by the reality presented by emerging economic powers from China to Brazil, from India to West Africa.\\n\\t\\t\\u00a0\\n\\n\\t\\tToday there are 4.8m SMEs in the UK yet 80 per cent currently do not trade overseas. In some cases there are specific reasons why exporting fails to make sense but for most a series of inhibitors are preventing these firms from benefiting from the advantages of exporting they understand only too well.\\n\\t\\t\\u00a0\\n\\n\\t\\tThis New Statesman supplement, in association with Barclays, explores these issues. At its heart is a round table discussion featuring the Business Secretary Vince Cable and a supporting cast of journalists, business leaders, economists and entrepreneurs. Elsewhere one of Cable\\u2019s predecessors\\n\\n\\t\\tMichael Heseltine, an entrepreneur in his own right, offers his own prescription for growth (page 10). Chuka Umunna, Labour\\u2019s shadow business secretary, reports back from a recent trip to West Africa and implores the UK to unlock the potential of diaspora communities back here (page 14).\\n\\n\\t\\tThe British \\u201cbrand\\u201d is strong, he writes.

And have you ever considered how difficult it would be to cook, to work, to function independently without your sight?\\n\\t\\u00a0\\n\\n\\tBeing able to see is something that is far too often taken for granted, despite it being vital to our wellbeing and ability to live a fulfilled and rewarding life.\\n\\t\\u00a0\\n\\n\\tIn this supplement, New Statesman explores both the need for measures to ensure our nation\\u2019s eye health remains a priority and the impact of policies and support mechanisms currently in place. We do so in partnership with UK Vision Strategy, a programme of activity developed in response to the World Health Assembly VISION 2020 resolution and which aims to improve support and services for blind and partially sighted people.\\n\\n\\t10 June 2013\\n\\n     &#13;\\n  &#13;\\n&#13;\\n&#13;\\n&#13;\\n&#13;\\n&#13;\\n  \\n  \\n    &#13;\\n            \\n\\t\\n\\n\\t\\u00a0\\n\\n\\tLack of safe water and sanitation, limited medical supplies, uncertain access to facilities and services. These are just a few of the health and social care challenges that Palestinians living in the occupied territories face every day \\u2013 challenges that threaten their lives, liberty and security.\\n\\n\\t\\u00a0\\n\\n\\tTo explore ways in which this crisis can be addressed, the New Statesman, with the support of the charity Medical Aid for Palestinians, held a round-table discussion with leading commentators. The conversation was informed, considered and animated as our participants debated the critical questions facing Palestinians.\\n\\t\\u00a0\\n\\n\\tFor instance, what are the main obstacles to health and medical care in Palestine and how can these best be tackled? Until a solution to these difficulties can be found, how can Palestine meet its health and medical needs? What steps can be taken to help unify the health-care system in Gaza and the West Bank? What impact does aid dependency have on Palestine\\u2019s ability to become a sustainable state? What role can the international\\n\\n\\tcommunity play to ensure that the region becomes sustainable? What impact has the UN bid had in situ? Have the Israeli elections, which took place in January, affected the situation on the ground?\\n\\n\\t\\u00a0\\n\\n\\tThere were no easy answers. With the Palestinian health and social care system unequivocally linked to the political situation, it was felt that long-lasting improvements could be made only if Israel and Palestine can resolve their conflict. Whether this presents itself as a one- or a two-state solution was the focus of much of our guests\\u2019 discussion, as was the role of the various actors on the world stage.\\n\\n\\t03 June 2013\\n\\n\\tDownload the PDF here\\n     &#13;\\n  &#13;\\n&#13;\\n&#13;\\n&#13;\\n&#13;\\n&#13;\\n  \\n  \\n    &#13;\\n            \\n\\t\\n\\n\\tWe\\u2019ve all seen the headlines that portray those on benefit as scroungers; we\\u2019ve most likely all heard ministers question the fairness for hardworking people having to foot the bill for the unemployed who \\u201csleep off a life on benefit\\u201d; and most of us will know someone who believes that poverty is the fault of the individual \\u2013 or who will argue that poverty doesn\\u2019t even exist in this country.\\n\\n\\tHow accurate are such perceptions? Are the views presented based on fact, or is it the case that evidence and statistics have been misused, misrepresented and manipulated to create propaganda for a war on welfare? And what effect do these attitudes have on those who are living below the poverty line?\\n\\n\\t\\u00a0\\n\\n\\tResearch has shown that myths and misunderstandings fuel stereotypes that negatively impact those living in poverty in the UK.

More people live longer, but more people are living with long-term conditions that affect their health (estimates say more than 15 million). The government's Health and Social Care Bill requires the NHS to make efficiency savings of 4 per cent per year \\u2013 the equivalent of \\u00a320bn of savings by 2015.\\n\\n\\t\\u00a0\\n\\n\\tWith such a significant reduction in NHS funding, how can we maintain the current level of services?\\n\\n\\t\\u00a0\\n\\n\\tA report by Sir Derek Wanless indicates that the two key variables which could affect the levels of funding required are the extent to which the NHS is able to achieve greater levels of productivity, and how far the general public becomes engaged with its own health, contributing to preventing disease rather than just treating it. Participants at our round table event explored how the NHS can maintain the standards of care it aspires to, while\\n\\n\\tresponding to the efficiency savings which have been imposed.\\n\\n\\t14 January 2013\\n\\n\\tDownload the PDF here\\n     &#13;\\n  &#13;\\n&#13;\\n&#13;\\n&#13;\\n&#13;\\n&#13;\\n  \\n  \\n    &#13;\\n            \\n\\t\\n\\n\\tIt is two years since changes to university tuition fees prompted thousands of students to take to the streets in protest. While the noise has quietened down, the impact of the hike in fees is still being felt \\u2013 not least in that it has contributed to the increasing politicisation of a generation of teenagers, according to the Political Studies Association (p10). It believes this is one of the influences driving year-on-year increases in the number\\n\\tof applications to study politics.\\n\\tBut as the other articles within this guide show, it is not simply interest in politics that is encouraging people to enrol on these courses. A degree in politics will stand graduates in good stead for rewarding and challenging careers in a variety of sectors and industries, not just within Westminster \\u2013 as our contributors demonstrate (p4-9).\\n\\tFinally, for those readers who have been suitably inspired to apply to university, either after their A-levels or as a mature student, our listings guide will help individuals find the right course for them.\\n\\n\\t17 December 2012\\n\\n\\tDownload the PDF here\\n     &#13;\\n  &#13;\\n&#13;\\n&#13;\\n&#13;\\n&#13;\\n&#13;\\n  \\n  \\n    &#13;\\n            \\n\\t\\n\\n\\tThe success or failure of vaccination programmes is about much more than simply science. Even when science can provide an effective vaccine with almost no side effects, to achieve \\u201cherd\\u201d or community immunity requires high vaccination rates. Only when enough people are vaccinated can we prevent a disease from taking hold in a community and provide immunity for those who are most vulnerable or who are not able to be vaccinated.\\n\\tThe UK is considered to be one of the leading countries in the world for vaccine policy and implementation and this supplement looks at the main issues that could risk destabilising the progress and development. On page 4, Shazia Sheikh looks at the varying success rates for the different approaches around Europe to meningitis C immunisation and identifies what the UK is doing right. On page 6, our round table participants consider the challenges ahead, in the context of the Health and Social Care Act; looking at issues around education and the way information is given to the public, and the perception of vaccine side effects, which is borne out of peoples\\u2019 trust and confidence in healthcare professionals. The discussion also\\n\\tlooks at the importance of partnerships between biotechnology companies, academia, pharmaceutical companies, governments and charities to stay ahead of the curve in vaccine policy.\\n\\tOn page 12, Liam Donaldson looks at the role of the UK in global public health. Child health specialists Dr David Elliman and Dr Helen Bedford look at public confidence in vaccines on page 13. Finally, on page 14, Linda Glennie warns us not to become too complacent or take the success achieved by\\n\\tvaccines for granted.\\n\\n\\t10 December 2012\\n\\n\\tDownload the PDF here\\n     &#13;\\n  &#13;\\n&#13;\\n&#13;\\n&#13;\\n&#13;\\n&#13;\\n  \\n  \\n    &#13;\\n            \\n\\t\\n\\n\\tStarting and growing a business can be fraught with difficulties, not least when trying to generate the funds needed to keep it afloat. Equally challenging, for policymakers and financial institutions at least, is how to develop the policies, products and services that will support the UK\\u2019s entrepreneurs.\\n\\n\\tFor some, the answer lies in equity finance. However, the combination of high levels of risk, information irregularities, steep due diligence and high compliance costs can make it difficult for smaller companies to access this type of funding. Others believe innovative funding mechanisms, such as peer-to-peer finance and crowd-funding, hold thekey. Relatively new to the market, these rely on the generosity of individuals or the collective cooperation of a group of people to get a project or company off the ground. Meanwhile, venture capital, angel investors and supply chain finance also have their own individual roles to play.\\n\\tTo assess how to address the challenge of access to finance, New Statesman, in partnership with ACCA, hosted a series of party conference fringe events. However, as the discussions were to illustrate, there is no one-size-fits-all solution.\\n\\n\\t3 December 2012\\n\\n\\tDownload the PDF here\\n     &#13;\\n  &#13;\\n&#13;\\n&#13;\\n&#13;\\n&#13;\\n&#13;\\n  \\n  \\n    &#13;\\n            \\n\\t\\n\\n\\tJohn Maynard Keynes once said that the importance of money flows from it being a link between the present and the future. Nowhere is this observation more relevant than when thinking about pensions. And yet, despite the need to plan for their future financial security and wellbeing, British people are woefully unprepared. Gone are the days where saving is the norm. Today, around 11 million people are failing to save enough to achieve a pension income they are likely to want or expect in retirement.\\n\\n\\tIn part, this shift in attitude has been the result of low unemployment, falling interest rates and the influx of cheap credit in the 1990s. But other\\n\\tfactors are also at play: higher education fees, a chaotic jobs market and the rising cost of housing have influenced perceptions of the affordability\\n\\tof saving, while the economic crisis, mis-selling of products and fixing of interest rates have impacted upon trust and confidence in private finance\\n\\tproducts.\\n\\n\\tTo assess how to address the pensions challenge, New Statesman, in partnership with Aviva, hosted a series of party conference fringe events.\\n\\tHowever, as the panellists were to discover, there was no easy answer.\\n\\n\\t26 November 2012\\n\\n\\tDownload the PDF here\\n     &#13;\\n  &#13;\\n&#13;\\n&#13;\\n&#13;\\n&#13;\\n&#13;\\n  \\n  \\n    &#13;\\n            \\n\\t\\n\\n\\n\\tThe coalition government is committed to investing a significant amount of money in green technologies and jobs between now and 2015. However, it is important to realise that this alone cannot transform Britain into a low-carbon economy. Given that 95 per cent of companies in the UK are small enterprises, it is imperative to engage these organisations in the emerging green economy and foster entrepreneurialism. .\\n\\n\\tTo address this issue, the New Statesman, in partnership with Shell and Demos, held a series of fringe events at the recent party conferences. The discussion, the highlights of which have been written up for the benefit of readers within these pages, focused on what the government can do to help and encourage small and medium-sized green enterprises and the extent to which big businesses have a responsibility to nurture them. There was agreement between many of our panellists that appropriate funding is key to success. Without it, there will be little chance for UK businesses to fine-tune their ideas or take an international leadership role.\\n\\n\\tThis is an issue not only for the banks, which have proved risk averse when it comes to lending to green businesses, but also for government. The Green Investment Bank, for example, is a good idea in principle but fails to address the funding needs of the small businesses that will shape our future.\\n\\n\\t07 November 2011\\n\\n\\t\\u00a0\\n     &#13;\\n  &#13;\\n&#13;\\n&#13;\\n&#13;\\n&#13;\\n&#13;\\n  \\n  \\n    &#13;\\n            \\n\\t\\n\\n\\n\\tThe near collapse of the euro, massive public spending cuts, protests, strikes, the scandals involving the media.

Which politicians and policies have the most impact on our lives? What are the strengths and limitations of democracy? How are rules and regulations determined? Whether readers want a policy role within the civil service, to campaign for change through a position at an NGO or have aspirations to be prime minister, a political studies course can set them on the right path.\\n\\n\\tThis guide aims to point students in the right direction.

By \\u201cputting choice and control in the hands of individuals and neighbourhoods\\u201d, it believes it can make public services more responsive to people\\u2019s needs. It is applying five key principles: increased choice; decentralising power to the \\u201clowest appropriate level\\u201d; diversity \\u2013 public services should be open to a range of providers; fair access to services; accountability \\u2013 our public services should be accountable to service users and taxpayers. .\\n\\n\\tIt all sounds like something we might be able to sign up to. However, choice requires that people are informed in a way that they understand and can use to bring about positive benefits for themselves. Choice needs to be genuine rather than simply a variety of providers offering the same services. And if we are having diversity, will all choices be available to all people in all areas? Will people be able to buy in services from their neighbouring local authority if what they want isn\\u2019t offered in their area?\\n\\n\\tCharities will be given more opportunities to bid for government money. Trustees and charity managers will have to make some careful decisions. However, are charities ready to deliver the types of public services that government wants and the public needs?

Demand for energy is increasing but traditional generation resources are diminishing. A rising number of homes and businesses are producing their own solar and wind power, while decentralised energy storage technologies need to be integrated. And on top of all of this, greenhouse gas emissions need to be dramatically reduced over the next few decades.\\n\\n\\tHow to address these challenges is something many energy, IT and government experts have been investing considerable time and, yes, energy in, and some of the new technologies and business models that are emerging as a result are discussed within these pages.\\n\\n\\tHowever, a successful transformation of our energy sector is dependent on all parties working together: the private sector, government and significantly the public. It is the responsibility of us all to ensure a more sustainable future for people and planet.\\n\\n\\t05 December 2011\\n\\n\\t\\u00a0\\n     &#13;\\n  &#13;\\n&#13;\\n&#13;\\n&#13;\\n&#13;\\n&#13;\\n  \\n  \\n    &#13;\\n            \\n\\t\\n\\n\\n\\tThe Health and Social Care Bill 2011 will bring on something of a revolution in the NHS \\u2013 the biggest change since it was established in 1948 \\u2013 and these developments will all take place in a landscape of enormous financial challenge. The NHS needs to deliver unprecedented productivity gains over the next few years. Many of the changes, such as enhancing the role of local authorities in the health system, giving health-care providers greater autonomy, and radically reforming commissioning to further involve GPs, have the potential to improve care for patients and to enhance the performance of the NHS. .\\n\\n\\tHowever, the Bill will also introduce a step change in implementing market-based principles in the health system, with the aim of improving diversity of supply, promoting competition, and increasing choice for patients. While the NHS needs to change, if the scale of change is too big, and the speed too fast, its performance during the transition could be affected unfavourably, disadvantaging patients instead of improving their care and their life chances.\\n\\n\\tContributors to this supplement consider how increasing competition in the NHS will affect us. We look at the relationship between citizens and the state and whether the original NHS values can be refounded within this new, broader agenda. How much choice will we actially have and how much influence over our health care? What if, collectively, we make poor choices? Services that are competing against each other will also be required to work together and integrate. How will that work and who will advise us and regulate all of this?\\n\\n\\t12 December 2011\\n\\n\\t\\u00a0\\n     &#13;\\n  &#13;\\n&#13;\\n&#13;\\n&#13;\\n&#13;\\n&#13;\\n  \\n  \\n    &#13;\\n            \\n\\t\\n\\n\\n\\tAs the world heats up and the effects of climate change become increasingly clear, governments have been given little choice but to introduce policies to reduce carbon emissions. The clean energy sector is to play a key role in this, and as such there has been an increased interest in the companies and technologies that support this industry.\\n\\n\\tProviding access to clean energy also stimulates economic development in less developed nations, offering those who choose to invest in this area with the potential to achieve more than just financial returns. Yet despite this enthusiasm, clean energy funds have not always performed well. Shaken by fluctuations in the stock market, impacted upon by developments in China and the natural gas industry, and affected by changes in government policy and regulation \\u2013 sometimes investors may wonder if just the slightest knock will send this sector tumbling.\\n\\n\\tDoes this mean things can only get better? This financial guide does not pretend to have all the answers. It simply aims to make some sense of clean energy investments for the benefit of our readers. As without a crystal ball, investors are, as always, at the mercy of the markets.\\n\\n\\t31 October 2011\\n\\n\\t\\u00a0\\n     &#13;\\n  &#13;\\n&#13;\\n&#13;\\n&#13;\\n&#13;\\n&#13;\\n  \\n  \\n    &#13;\\n            \\n\\t\\n\\n\\n\\tAs union members gather in central London for the 143rd annual Trades Union Congress on 12-14 September, there is much talk of strikes and resistance. The threat of industrial action remains the single biggest obstacle to the coalition\\u2019s cuts. Despite a steep decline in membership over the past 30 years, unions continue to enjoy unrivalled legitimacy.\\n\\n\\tIn the following pages, we examine whether the trade unions are up to the challenge of taking on the government, and hear from the general-secretaries of seven of the biggest unions.\\n\\n\\tCan the leaders of Britain\\u2019s 7m-strong union movement build a grass-roots coalition, a broad church, that reaches out beyond trade union and Labour Party members to charities, community groups and public-service users?

School inspectors will be instructed to concentrate on four areas: achievement, teaching, leadership and management, and behaviour and safety. In addition, the Secretary of State will be given powers to intervene in schools that are failing while \\u201cliberating\\u201d outstanding schools and colleges from routine inspection.\\n\\n\\tNotwithstanding the merit or otherwise of the changes the legislation will bring, the implications for head teachers expected to implement it are significant. In such a complex and demanding world, it is not easy to make the best choices.\\n\\n\\tAmong the questions raised are: at what level should education standards be set? What is the best way to reach them? What are the benefits and challenges of collaboration with other schools? What impact will the growing number of academies have on the state system, particularly in a world of increased parental choice? The NS and the National Association of Head Teachers brought together a panel of experts to provide some of the answers.\\n\\n\\t05 September 2011\\n\\n\\t\\u00a0\\n     &#13;\\n  &#13;\\n&#13;\\n&#13;\\n&#13;\\n&#13;\\n&#13;\\n  \\n  \\n    &#13;\\n            \\n\\t\\n\\n\\n\\tFinancial markets are full of fear and fluctuation at the moment. They have been shaken by successive events such as the Greek debt crisis, the US rating downgrade, civil unrest and uncertainty across North Africa and the Middle East, and escalating commodity prices.\\n\\n\\tAll of these derive from beyond our shores and yet private investors in the UK have to decide how to protect their interests against this background. The challenge they face is to preserve their wealth while avoiding its erosion through adverse market movements, inflation, taxation and costs levied by financial services providers.\\n\\n\\tIt is not easy to make the best choices on where to invest, yet to do nothing is to allow inflation to take its toll. This investment strategy supplement aims to offer readers ideas and principles that they can use to guide their thinking. There is no silver bullet, no one-shot solution that will overcome the forces at play. But at least some of the risks can be contained. And choices made now, while markets are in turmoil, may prove fruitful later when they are more stable.\\n\\n\\t22 August 2011\\n\\n\\t\\u00a0\\n     &#13;\\n  &#13;\\n&#13;\\n&#13;\\n&#13;\\n&#13;\\n&#13;\\n  \\n  \\n    &#13;\\n            \\n\\t\\n\\n\\n\\tThe 2050 goal of reducing the UK\\u2019s carbon emissions by 80 per cent compared with 1990 levels is a high priority for the country. While some of us say we agree with these climate change goals, in reality, our behaviour is not compatible with them. For various reasons, we are resistant to nuclear power, to wind farms in our backyards, and to lifestyle changes.\\n\\n\\tHowever, if we don\\u2019t want to see our bills go up, the planet sustain further damage or energy supplies grow insecure, somehow we have to change. Current coalition policy is to let the market decide which pathway provides the best way forwards. But is it really the job of the market to keep the lights on in Britain? What would happen if it chose to sacrifice secure electricity supplies for lower costs? Government does not seem quite sure whether electricity is a commodity or a social service.\\n\\n\\tThe market is in a state of flux; the way that it is financed needs to change. What if the result of this is that targets are not met and we end up with an inadvertent result?

Future energy prices are highly unpredictable, commodity shortages are likely, and no single technology can deliver all of our energy requirements. Our security, what we can afford and our commitment to reducing carbon emissions and tackling climate change require that we have a diverse mix of energy types. This means that those working in the energy marketplace have to make assumptions about future trends and outcomes.\\n\\n\\tSome types of energy are perceived as \\u201cgood\\u201d (usually renewable energy, such as wind power, hydropower and solar power) and others as \\u201cbad\\u201d (usually coal, gas and nuclear energy). While there is no other option but to invest in renewable energy (and the sector is expanding), traditional sources of energy cannot be ignored.\\n\\n\\tThe cost of fossil fuels is still comparatively low and the time when low-carbon options will reach parity is some way off.

Which is why it is so vital that regulators and politicians find a way to conserve our precious social heritage while keeping people safe and healthy.

It employs over 72,000 people, invests considerably in research and development, and contributes \\u00a37bn a year to the economy. It also has access to a strong academic base that offers extensive expertise in translational medicine and database studies, while the NHS offers data and research opportunities unmatched anywhere else in the world thanks to its national database of patient records.\\n\\n\\tWith so many benefits and opportunities, it would appear that little can hinder the UK\\u2019s position as a world leader in this field. However, globally the life sciences industry is changing. The financial crisis has hindered funding opportunities \\u2013 just as it has in other sectors, and investments and workforces are being consolidated. At the same time, the market place is becoming increasingly competitive.\\n\\n\\tWhat impact is this likely to have on the UK pharmaceutical and life sciences sectors? What is needed to ensure a position of leadership and that they remain attractive to investors, companies and academia? To address all these questions and more, New Statesman, in partnership with Pfizer, has brought some of the leading voices together.\\n\\n\\t16 January 2012\\n\\n\\t\\u00a0\\n     &#13;\\n  &#13;\\n&#13;\\n&#13;\\n&#13;\\n&#13;\\n&#13;\\n  \\n  \\n    &#13;\\n            \\n\\t\\n\\n\\n\\tThe government attempts to prevent anti-competitive practices \\u2013 operations that are against the public interest. Competition policy is one of the pillars of the internal market and competition law and regulation should protect competition by controlling the operation of firms that may have monopoly power in their own industry, as this may lead to consumers being exploited. Markets work best when there is a healthy rivalry between companies and they compete to serve active and informed customers who want and are able to reward good performers and withhold reward from those who don\\u2019t measure up. .\\n\\n\\tLaw should make monopoly and oligopoly impossible, and should encourage new market entry, wider choice, lower prices and higher quality. Regulation is designed to deal with the problem of market failure \\u2013 where markets fail to reach an optimal allocation of resources. However, as Phillip Blond points out, many interventions by regulators have had perverse consequences, including market concentration, with a shrinking number of competitors, further increasing the possibility of a monopolist or semi-monopolist control of the market. This means that the market becomes further and further removed from free and genuine competition.\\n\\n\\tHow can we create the competition policy and regulation \\u2013 with a proper accountability structure \\u2013 that the UK needs for growth, innovation and the widening of ownership and prosperity?

Last month, a bill was presented to parliament that aims to resolve the issue once and for all.\\n\\n\\tAt its heart is the requirement that 80 per cent of House of Lords members are to be elected by the British public for a non-renewable 15-year term. Gone will be the life peers, and in their place a system that enables members to resign, to be expelled and to be suspended. No longer will members be able to claim \\u00a3300 a day simply for turning up; instead pay will be related to their level of input into parliamentary business.\\n\\n\\tOpponents to the bill claim there is no public appetite for it; that it is a waste of parliamentary time; that an elected Lords would challenge the authority of the House of Commons. Yet these voices have failed to acknowledge one crucial factor \\u2013 that an unelected second chamber has no place in a country that prides itself on its democratic principles.\\n\\n\\t16 July 2012\\n\\n\\tDownload the PDF here\\n     &#13;\\n  &#13;\\n&#13;\\n&#13;\\n&#13;\\n&#13;\\n&#13;\\n  \\n  \\n    &#13;\\n            \\n\\t\\n\\n\\tPlans to \\u201crestore rigour in the key primary subjects\\u201d were set out by Education Secretary Michael Gove recently in his new draft overhaul of the Primary National Curriculum.\\n\\n\\tThe plans propose a back-to-basics curriculum, focusing on times-tables, spelling and grammar. Pupils will be expected to have learned their times-tables up to 12 by the age of nine, to multiply and divide fractions by the age of 11 and to start learning and reciting poetry from five years old. The coalition Government has made much of giving schools more autonomy in how and what they teach. Some have welcomed the renewed focus on the traditional \\u201cthree Rs\\u201d as good preparation for secondary school. However, some union leaders fear that this heavily prescribed curriculum will leave little room for teachers to adapt learning to their individual pupils\\u2019 needs and to make lessons exciting for them.\\n\\n\\tThis supplement looks at how far a very traditional approach can be reconciled with what we now know about the benefits of a creative education, which promotes the ability to question, make connections, innovate, problem-solve, communicate, collaborate and to reflect critically. Can we have both rigour and creativity? Can we avoid throwing the baby out with the bathwater?.\\n\\n\\t2 July 2012\\n\\n\\tDownload the PDF here\\n     &#13;\\n  &#13;\\n&#13;\\n&#13;\\n&#13;\\n&#13;\\n&#13;\\n  \\n  \\n    &#13;\\n            \\n\\t\\n\\n\\n\\tThe world has a serious problem on its hands \\u2013 that of how to feed its rapidly growing population.

In this New Statesman supplement, supported by the Crop Protection Association, we explore the contribution science and engineering have made to food production and security, and the opportunities they present for the future.\\n\\n\\tWe also discuss some of the policy changes that are needed to ensure no one goes hungry.\\n\\n\\t18 June 2012\\n     &#13;\\n  &#13;\\n&#13;\\n&#13;\\n&#13;\\n&#13;\\n&#13;\\n  \\n  \\n    &#13;\\n            \\n\\t\\n\\n\\n\\tGiven that gambling is one of the earliest forms of entertainment in human history, it is safe to assume it is here to stay. Its roots can be traced to religious rituals in primitive pre-historic societies. From these rituals, gambling grew into a separate activity used to make decisions about who would get a bigger piece of prey or a woman. Eventually pure gambling for material gain evolved.\\n\\n\\tThe Victorians found gambling deeply immoral and irreligious. In 1906 the Street Betting Act was passed,making street betting illegal. The only legal betting was that done at the race track. This suddenly put legal gambling as a leisure pursuit out of reach for a generation of working men who had neither the time nor the money to attend the races.\\n\\n\\tAs the 20th century progressed, the government moulded legislation to limit and control gambling opportunitieswhile drawing revenue from them. Todaygambling is global, yet the tension between regulators and the owners of gambling businesses still exists. With jobs and businesses at stake, now more than ever before the industry is fighting for what it regards as a fair deal from government\\n\\n\\t25 April 2012\\n\\n\\t\\u00a0\\n     &#13;\\n  &#13;\\n&#13;\\n&#13;\\n&#13;\\n&#13;\\n&#13;\\n  \\n  \\n    &#13;\\n            \\n\\t\\n\\n\\n\\tDoctors have always tried to make as accurate a diagnosis as possible for every patient, taking into account their family history, their age and so on. In the past, when prescribing a drug or treatment, they have also taken into account any other illnesses the patient might have, and any likely side effects.\\n\\n\\tBut, recently, this \\u201cpersonalisation\\u201d of medicine has changed gear. Advances in technology now mean that doctors are increasingly able to make a more complex and deeper diagnosis and prescribe different drugs, because they can get detailed information about each patient\\u2019s individual genetic make up. They also have a better understanding of molecular factors of diseases.\\n\\n\\tThe old ways of working need to change if we are to be able to share the benefits of these advances equally. New drugs are being carefully regulated but what about new methods of diagnosis? Should our existing drugs and diagnostics not be subjected to the same new rigour? These are just some of the questions that are considered by experts in the field who share their experiences in this supplement.\\n\\n\\t26 March 2012\\n\\n\\t\\u00a0\\n     &#13;\\n  &#13;\\n&#13;\\n&#13;\\n&#13;\\n&#13;\\n&#13;\\n  \\n  \\n    &#13;\\n            \\n\\t\\n\\n\\n\\tBack in the day, saving used to be common place with much of the population keeping behind a proportion of their wages for a rainy day. That was until the mid 1990s when a combination of low unemployment, falling interest rates and markets awash with credit provided more of an incentive to borrow than save. Building a nest egg, whether to pay for a deposit on a house or to see you through your retirement, suddenly wasn\\u2019t as popular. .\\n\\n\\tToday\\u2019s government is keen to reverse that trend \\u2013which is perhaps not surprising given we\\u2019re a nation saddled with debt and a massive pension problem. It is keen to turn us back into a population of savers, for whom setting income aside is second nature.\\n\\n\\tOne financial product that could help set us on our way is the Individual Savings Account \\u2013 or ISA as they are more commonly known. Tax-efficient and with a range of options available to meet a variety of needs, ISAs have potential both as a temporary and long-term savings vehicle. But they also have their short comings. To help shed a little light on the issue, New Statesman, in partnership with Governor, have produced this handy guide.\\n\\n\\t19 March 2012\\n\\n\\t\\u00a0\\n     &#13;\\n  &#13;\\n&#13;\\n&#13;\\n&#13;\\n&#13;\\n&#13;\\n  \\n  \\n    &#13;\\n            \\n\\t\\n\\n\\n\\tIs the government committed to tackling poverty in the UK? It\\u2019s an issue that has been the subject of much debate, with tough economic conditions, high unemployment and changes to the welfare state leaving many commentators fearing the worst for the poorer members of our society. .\\n\\n\\tBut as this supplement highlights, the question should not be whether the government should tackle poverty, but how. Supported by the Webb Memorial Trust, New Statesman explores what has changed since 1909 when Beatrice and Sidney Webb conducted their seminal research into the causes of poverty and what, if anything, can we learn from the past? What role can the labour market play? And why are those most affected by poverty \\u2013 children and young people \\u2013 excluded from the debate?\\n\\n\\t27 February 2012\\n\\n\\t\\u00a0\\n     &#13;\\n  &#13;\\n&#13;\\n&#13;\\n&#13;\\n&#13;\\n&#13;\\n  \\n  \\n    \\n  \\n  \\n  \\n  \\n  \\n  \\n\",\n                \"source\": \"www.newstatesman.com\",\n                \"publishDate\": \"2015-04-20T16:00:03.455+02:00\",\n                \"sourceType\": \"web\",\n                \"language\": \"en\",\n                \"googleRank\": 8,\n                \"relatedDocs\": [\n\n                ]\n            },\n            {\n                \"id\": 186757750,\n                \"url\": \"http:\\/\\/www.noodls.com\\/noodls.asp\",\n                \"title\": \"\\n\\nBrown University\\nStudents win Beinecke, Goldwater, and Udall scholarships\\n-1m\\n\\n\\nNational Assembly of the Republic of Armenia\\nGalust Sahakyan Takes Part in the Opening of the Monument Dedicated to th\",\n                \"content\": \"\\n\\nBrown University\\nStudents win Beinecke, Goldwater, and Udall scholarships\\n-1m\\n\\n\\nNational Assembly of the Republic of Armenia\\nGalust Sahakyan Takes Part in the Opening of the Monument Dedicated to the Armenian Genocide Centennial\\n-1m\\n\\n\\nUnion syndicale Solidaires\\nRassemblement pour l'accueil des r\\u00e9fugi\\u00e9-es et des migrant-es, contre l'indiff\\u00e9rence meurtri\\u00e8re\\n-1m\\n\\n\\nRochdale AFC Ltd.\\nGoldbond Results Week...\\n-1m\\n\\n\\nMinistry of Foreign Affairs of the Republic of Latvia\\nEdgars Rinkevics: Georgia\\u2019s progress should receive appropriate consideration at the Riga Summit\\n-1m\\n\\n\\nColombia National Army\\nCOMUNICADO DE PRENSA\\n-1m\\n\\n\\nAston Villa plc\\nVilla 2-1 Liverpool: Delph on cloud nine after semi-final win\\n-1m\\n\\n\\nBundesliga - DFL Deutsche Fu\\u00dfball Liga GmbH\\nJetzt richetet Werder den Blick auf die Europa League\\n-1m\\n\\n\\nMinistry of Agriculture and Rural Development of Romania\\nCOMUNICAT DE PRESA\\n-1m\\n\\n\\nACU - Auto-Cycle Union\\nCARLESS DOMINATES ROUND 2 TO LEAD PRO CHAMPIONSHIP\\n-1m\\n\\n\\nSJR in Scandinavia AB\\nRedovisningsansvarig till ett teknikkonsultf\\u00f6retag\\n-1m\\n\\n\\nKBM Banka AD Kragujevac\\nOdr\\u017eana XIII vanredna sednica Skup\\u0161tine KBM banke\\n-1m\\n\\n\\nCPSA - Clay Pigeon Shooting Association\\nESP Reg at E J Churchill's on 26th April \\u2013 20th April, 2015\\n-1m\\n\\n\\nComune di Montauro\\nItalicum:M5S,pronti lasciare Commissione\\n-2m\\n\\n\\nComune di Montauro\\nCuba: municipali, anche Fidel ha votato\\n-2m\\n\\n\\nAzienda USL 2 Lucca\\nNumero dedicato per le informazioni sulla meningite\\n-2m\\n\\n\\nExeter City AFC Ltd.\\nGrecians hand over cheque to CLIC Sargent\\n-2m\\n\\n\\nFIV - Federazione Italiana Vela\\nA Varazze condizioni ottimali chiudono la II Tappa del Trofeo Optimist Italia Kinder+Sport\\n-2m\\n\\n\\nBradford City FC Ltd.\\nPARKINSON LOOKING FOR SAME AGAIN\\n-2m\\n\\n\\nFC Schalke 04 e.V.\\nS04 erh\\u00e4lt Lizenz ohne Auflagen und Bedingungen\\n-2m\\n\\n\\nMinistry of Personnel, Public Grievances and Pensions of the Republic of India\\nCSS Officers demand parity with IAS and other services\\n-2m\\n\\n\\nPennsylvania Turnpike Commission\\nDaytime Express E-ZPass Lane Closure Scheduled for April 21 at Gateway Toll Plaza\\n-2m\\n\\n\\nArma dei Carabinieri\\nAnzio (RM) - Spara al presunto rivale in amore: arrestato un 27enne\\n-2m\\n\\n\\nConfesercenti - Confederazione italiana esercenti attivit\\u00e0 commerciali turistiche e dei servizi\\nUe: ok al tetto per i costi delle carte di credito\\n-2m\\n\\n\\nConfesercenti - Confederazione italiana esercenti attivit\\u00e0 commerciali turistiche e dei servizi\\nInps, Boeri: \\u201cProposta per reddito minimo over 55\\u201d\\n-2m\\n\\n\\nJoseph B.

such as CISSP, GIAC, and IRAP - but would be specific to the Australian environment and its skills requirements, AISA said.\\n\\u201cThe program will include skills confirmation and continuing professional development requirements, which will be managed by AISA,\\u201d the organisation wrote.\\n\\u201cTo support this scheme, AISA proposes to provide ongoing education and professional development opportunities to its members in cooperation with organisations such as AusCERT.\\n\\\"AISA will also engage with both the public and private sectors to encourage and explain the long term benefits of supporting this program.\\u201d\\nSecurity skills shortage\\nAISA echoed concerns raised by the Comms Alliance around a skills gap in the local infosec industry and the increasing amount of skilled infosec specialists leaving Australia.\\nThe Comms Alliance highlighted a lack of skills in areas including forensics, pen testing, incident management and risk assessment, and urged the Government to include a targeted program to retain and develop such expertise within its revised cyber security strategy.\\nAISA similarly listed pen testing, forensics, security architects and application security testers among the skills currently in short supply across Australia.\\nIt said this shortage could be addressed by reviewing tertiary education and vocational training offerings as well as sponsoring employment of graduates leaving university with such skills.\\nGreater investment in research and development of products and services in Australia - rather than relying on overseas companies - would encourage the retention and growth of in-demand skills locally.\\n\\u201cProfessional networks are imperative. The industry, and our adversaries, all move too fast for us to try to capture all approaches to each risk and\\/or threat in a core body of knowledge which is formally taught in detail over a set period of time,\\u201d AISA wrote.\\n\\u201cUltimately, what will be most important is a strong grounding in a particular discipline (e.g. like computer science, or engineering), training in high level frameworks and principles, communications skills, and an individual\\u2019s professional network.\\u201d\\nThe Department of Prime Minister and Cabinet - the agency leading the review - said it had so far consulted with over 140 organisations globally. It expects to complete and release the revised review midway through this year.\\n\\u00a0Copyright  \\u00a9 iTnews.com.au .

Ten thousand of these hires would be from Israel in the cyber security domain, for which it would be tapping the Israeli government, Pillai said. Another 10,000 hires are going to be in Mexico, and the last 10,000 would be made from among the ranks of India's differently abled, he said.UST Global, which is targeting a topline of $3 billion in the next two years, claims to be the fastest organically growing company in Indian IT. Pillai said a new campus with a built-up area of three million square feet is coming up in Thiruvananthapuram at a cost of $200 million. Apart from Thiruvananthapuram, the company is present in six Indian cities, he said.Pillai said the company's early bets on retail and healthcare has paid off with most of the growth in IT in the past three years coming from these verticals. In his view, this will remain so for the next five to ten years. Pillai said the company has identified that the six basic services of design, cyber security (in partnership with Israeli spy agency Mossad), analytics, cloud, mobility, and social are going to decide the intersection of technology and business, and would be focusing on them.UST Global Chief Administrative Officer Alexander Varghese announced the signing of a seven-year, $38-million engagement with the Madhya Pradesh government on digitisation and automation of urban local bodies. The programme, which is an end-to-end eGovernance engagement, will touch 377 local bodies, he said.Pillai further said the company has launched a venture capital (VC) fund based in Bengaluru, for which the initial investments will be the tune of $20 million. He said the VC fund will tap into the learnings from the company's similar initiatives in Palo Alto and Israel. Among the interesting work done by the company, it is rolling out a software product to apply analytics to cricket, for which the tie-up with Chennai Super Kings &amp;mdash; with UST Global as the principal sponsor &amp;mdash; will come in handy, he said. It's also building a commerce engine for a leading telecom company which will allow one to have the exact same branding imprint in all the nine major social media.\",\n                \"source\": \"www.deccanherald.com\",\n                \"publishDate\": \"2015-04-20T15:07:46+02:00\",\n                \"sourceType\": \"web\",\n                \"language\": \"en\",\n                \"googleRank\": 7,\n                \"relatedDocs\": [\n\n                ]\n            },\n            {\n                \"id\": 186770749,\n                \"url\": \"http:\\/\\/feeds.businesswire.com\\/click.phdo?i=ad7e8968f93c66ec77ebed521ddf1236\",\n                \"title\": \"\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tBURLINGTON, Vt.--(BUSINESS WIRE)--Champlain College today announced that it has formed an alliance with \\n      the U.S. Office of Personnel Management (OPM) to bring its online \\n      programs to\",\n                \"content\": \"\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tBURLINGTON, Vt.--(BUSINESS WIRE)--Champlain College today announced that it has formed an alliance with \\n      the U.S. Office of Personnel Management (OPM) to bring its online \\n      programs to the Federal government\\u2019s more than two million employees. \\n      Through truED\\u00ae, Federal employees, their spouses and legal adult \\n      dependents will pay up to 70 percent less than standard tuition rates \\n      for the College\\u2019s online programs and can make monthly tuition payments \\n      under Champlain College\\u2019s unique payment model.\\n    \\n\\n\\n    \\n      Under the alliance, Federal employees and their families worldwide will \\n      be able to affordably pursue more than 60 certificate, bachelor\\u2019s and \\n      master\\u2019s degree programs in high-growth, in-demand and mission-critical \\n      fields.

Passages represents \\n      a fundamentally new approach to protecting against a range of web-based \\n      attacks, enabling businesses to safely and confidently forge ahead in \\n      today\\u2019s global, web-based world.

This \\n      design prevents all unwanted communication between the local machine and \\n      the virtual environment. A virtual private network then segregates all \\n      network traffic from the browser protecting the enterprise\\u2019s identity, \\n      avoiding targeting and mitigating against pivot attacks. This also \\n      prevents an attacker from moving away from the browser to the local \\n      machine and ultimately other devices on the local network.\\n    \\n    \\n      Passages\\u2019 Safehold prevents all drive-by downloads and other malware \\n      from reaching the user\\u2019s computer during a browsing session by \\n      restricting all downloads to a secure cloud server, where they are \\n      scanned and determined malware-free before permission is granted to \\n      transfer to the desktop.

By joining together, these federal, state, and local agencies serve as an effective deterrent to cyber criminals.\\u201d\\n\\nWotring made an initial appearance before United States Magistrate Judge Robert H.

Within each field office territory, the CTF synchronizes domestic cyber threat investigations in the local community through information sharing, incident response, and joint enforcement and intelligence actions. To its partner agencies, the Cyber Task Force Program provides real-time, classified reporting, training opportunities, and access to a broad scope of resources, including vehicles, communication tools, and computer equipment.\\n\\nThe public is reminded that, as in any criminal case, a person is presumed innocent until and unless proven guilty.

(NYSE:NSR), \\n      a trusted, neutral provider of real-time information services and \\n      analytics, today announced findings from its 2015 \\n      North America Denial of Service (DDoS) Attacks &amp; Impact Report. \\n      The findings highlight an increase in the number and size of DDoS \\n      attacks, their costly and devastating effects on brand perception, and a \\n      heightened state of preparedness for North American businesses.\\n    \\n      Key survey findings:\\n    \\n      \\n        91 percent say DDoS attacks are a bigger or same threat as last year\\n      \\n      \\n        85 percent of companies are attacked multiple times\\n      \\n      \\n        32 percent of companies would lose more than $100k in revenue per hour \\n        of attack\\n      \\n      \\n        26 percent report DDoS attacks adversely affect customer trust and \\n        brand reputation\\n      \\n      \\n        31 percent say their longest attacks last more than one day\\n      \\n    \\n      \\u201cWith 51 percent of companies investing more of their annual budget to \\n      prevent DDoS attacks, this study proves that DDoS has transcended to an \\n      institutional threat that is very real and recognized by all members of \\n      the C-suite,\\u201d said Margee Abrams, CISSP, director of security services \\n      at Neustar. \\u201cA website attack that was once considered to be an IT \\n      problem now reverberates and can cause significant brand damage that \\n      affects all organizational employees and its customers.\\u201d\\n    \\n      As a response to the pervasive DDoS attacks, companies have increased \\n      their adoption of Hybrid protection by 55 percent from last year.\\n    \\n      Hybrid, a highly recommended approach that allows companies to mitigate \\n      DDoS attacks by combining on-site hardware and cloud-based solutions, is \\n      also the defense of choice by 94 percent of companies who would lose \\n      more than $100k per hour during peak business times.\\n    \\n\\n\\n\\n\\n      \\u201cThe increased hybrid adoption reflects the growing need for companies \\n      to have immediate, on premise DDoS defense capabilities, in addition to \\n      surge defense capabilities in response to larger attacks,\\u201d said Abrams. \\n      \\u201cCompanies continue to rely on layered traditional perimeter defenses \\n      including firewalls, routers and switches as well as DDoS mitigation \\n      services.

LTE is now a global reality for millions of subscribers and the age of the Internet of Things (IoT) is well and truly upon us. While this opens up a variety of opportunities for network operators, it also comes with a warning. With the vast increase in the number of connected devices, effective policy and traffic management capabilities have become key demands for carriers and, as such, network intelligence is more important than ever.Apr. 19, 2015 12:00 PM EDTBy Dana GardnerAriba today announced innovations to its cloud-based applications and global business network designed to deliver a personal, contextual and increasingly mobile-first user experience for business applications consumers.&#13;\\nAmong the announcements are a newly designed user interface (UI) and a mobile app based on the SAP Fiori approach, both due to be available this summer, for Ariba's core procurement, spend management, and other line of business apps.

Denial of Service (DoS), SQL injections and cross-site scripting are the most common web attack vectors, increasing in popularity. As migration to the cloud continues and expands, companies today are facing a more distributed network infrastructure. This transition of web based applications to the cloud have rendered on-premise mitigation tools ineffective against web attacks and require organizations to protect their applications both on-premise and in-the-cloud.Radware's new Hybrid Cloud WAF Service is an industry first that provides a fully managed enterprise grade WAF that protects both on-premise and cloud-based applications, using a single technology solution. Unlike existing WAF solutions that integrate dual technologies which results in a gap between protection coverage and quality, Radware's single technology approach makes migrating applications to the cloud safer and secure.\\\"It's not uncommon for enterprises to distribute their applications both on-premise and in-the-cloud. In addition, we see enterprises employ multiple cloud vendors to host various aspects of their infrastructure. However, having a disparate network infrastructure adds a level of complexity when trying to protect your web applications,\\\" says Carl Herberger, vice president of security solutions for Radware. \\\"We have taken actionable steps to provide enterprise with a unified hybrid solution against web-based attacks regardless if protection is needed on-premise or in the cloud and provide better security when moving applications to the cloud as well as ease of security policy orchestration and automation.\\\"In addition to protection from various web attacks, Radware's Hybrid Cloud WAF can also defend and mitigate a wide range of DDoS attacks through its always-on DDoS attack protection, and provide comprehensive detection and mitigation of attacks with minimal false positives and no impact on legitimate traffic.\\\"When there is no technical integration between on-premise and cloud WAF technologies, organizations are faced with poor quality of detection resulting in poor mitigation options,\\\" says Jon Oltsik, senior principal analyst, Enterprise Strategy Group. \\\"Radware's Hybrid Cloud WAF Service can help bridge this gap by integrating its on-premise devices and WAF technologies with cloud-based coverage to deliver a comprehensive detection and mitigation solution.\\\"The Hybrid Cloud WAF Service also provides full coverage from all of OWASP's Top 10 security risks and is backed by Radware's Emergency Response Team \\u2013 a dedicated group of security experts that can actively monitor and mitigate attacks in real time.For additional information on Radware's Hybrid Cloud WAF service, please visit http:\\/\\/www.radware.com\\/hybridcloudwaf or visit Radware at booth S2021 during this year's RSA Conference in San Francisco, CA.About RadwareRadware (Nasdaq:RDWR), is a global leader of application delivery and application security solutions for virtual, cloud and software defined data centers.

Humphries II claimed under oath that he \\\"was told by supervisors that\\\" the 2012 presidential election \\\"would explain the potential reason why there was so much interference\\\" in the case \\\"from headquarters, that nobody wanted this case during an election cycle.\\\"The deposition is part of the lawsuit brought by Dr. Scott and Jill Kelley against government agencies, departments and major figures in the Obama administration for allegedly defaming their character in the Petraeus-Broadwell sex scandal. The affair between Petraeus and Broadwell, his biographer-turned lover, brought a disgraced end to the decorated general's career.Though the Kelleys were the victims of the original cyberstalking case, as the Petraeus scandal exploded in the public, many in the media painted Jill Kelley in a particularly unflattering light.Petraeus pleaded guilty last month to one federal charge of removing and retaining classified information, having improperly shared his black books with Broadwell and lied about it to the FBI. He is scheduled to be sentenced on Thursday. All charges against Broadwell were dropped in December 2012.Humphries testified he believed Kelley's name had been leaked by someone at FBI headquarters \\\"and it seemed to be a purposeful attempt to discredit both Mrs. Kelley and myself.\\\"Humphries said in his deposition he was confused by FBI's leaders' focus on Jill Kelley instead of Broadwell, whom they identified as the cyberstalker as early as June 2012. He testified her actions compromised security of high-level military intelligence personnel and information, but for some reason higher-ups in the FBI kept interfering in what seemed to him to be a fairly straightforward case. In one incident, FBI agents were called back from the airport as they were about to fly to North Carolina to interview Broadwell.All the while, the FBI kept shifting focus on the victims in the case, Humphries testified, or more specifically on Jill Kelley. He wondered if this warped view of the case was rooted in \\\"ineptness, incompetence or was politically motivated,\\\" he testified.Law enforcement officials told CNN what Humphries and others regarded as interference from headquarters could also be seen as efforts to ensure the FBI did everything by the book in a highly sensitive case. (They got court-approved warrants for things normally the FBI can administratively subpoena). Some at the FBI thought Humphries did things to keep inserting himself into the case even after he was told to recuse himself given that he had a friendly relationship with Kelley. Those efforts allegedly include attempts at communication that Humphries is said to have had during the course of the investigations with then-House Majority Leader Eric Cantor, R-Virginia.He testified that he and his wife and children are friends with the Kelleys and their children through their outreach to the military and law enforcement communities in Tampa, and did not understand his bosses' insinuations or harsh judgments.A request for comment made by CNN to a representative of Paula Broadwell was not met by press time.Alan Raul, an attorney for the Kelleys, also declined comment to CNN on Sunday, as did Petraeus attorney Robert Barnett. A spokesman for the Justice Department did not return a call from CNN on Sunday; a spokesman for the FBI did not offer any comment. The administration has refrained from commenting on the case in the past given the current litigation.FBI blaming the victims?The story began in May 2012, when four-star Gen. John Allen began receiving emails from \\\"kelleypatrol@gmail.com,\\\" which \\\"disparaged\\\" Kelley and referenced an upcoming private dinner the Kelleys were hosting with \\\"several senior foreign intelligence, defense and diplomatic officials,\\\" according to the lawsuit. The email troubled Allen given the potential security concern and \\\"frightened the Kelleys, as it indicated that Mrs. Kelley was being followed or stalked, and raised serious concerns about her own safety and well being, particularly given the number of terrorist risks faced by CENTCOM leaders.\\\"Broadwell later admitted to having sent that email as well as another from \\\"Tampa Angel\\\" to Dr. Scott Kelley, also disparaging his wife, promising \\\"embarrassment for all, including spouses, such as info in national headlines.\\\"Jill Kelley reached out to Humphries, an FBI Agent whom she and her husband knew socially. \\\"She explained that Gen. Allen had received an odd email,\\\" Humphries testified, noting that \\\"whoever sent these emails is either in close physical proximity or has penetrated the cyber security of these folks to include the director of the Central Intelligence Agency, Director Petraeus, and I was worried and concerned for his safety, the safety of the generals.\\\"Humphries thought the emails \\\"ominous\\\" and contacted Special Agent Adam Malone of the Tampa Cyber Squad. \\\"We had already reached the threshold on the cyber or physical security of senior government leadership and possible their email,\\\" he said.By the third week of June, the FBI had identified Broadwell as the cyberstalker, Humphries said, relating how he saw FBI videotape of \\\"a BMW pulling up to a Starbucks in North Carolina and shortly thereafter the alleged subject of the case enters and logs on, and some of the emails were being sent, so they had a firm idea of who it was.\\\"\\n\\n            \",\n                \"source\": \"www.wcyb.com\",\n                \"publishDate\": \"2015-04-20T10:01:11+02:00\",\n                \"sourceType\": \"web\",\n                \"language\": \"en\",\n                \"googleRank\": 5,\n                \"relatedDocs\": [\n\n                ]\n            },\n            {\n                \"id\": 186700771,\n                \"url\": \"http:\\/\\/www.msn.com\\/en-ph\\/news\\/world\\/new-zealand-pm-happy-to-talk-to-china-about-spy-claims\\/ar-AAbl0x3?srcref=rss\",\n                \"title\": \"\\n New Zealand Prime Minister John Key on Monday invited Chinese officials to quiz him about reports that Wellington worked with US intelligence on a plan to hack Chinese diplomatic communications.\\n \\n\\n\",\n                \"content\": \"\\n New Zealand Prime Minister John Key on Monday invited Chinese officials to quiz him about reports that Wellington worked with US intelligence on a plan to hack Chinese diplomatic communications.\\n \\n\\n \\n  \\n     &#13;\\n        &#13;\\n    &#13;\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n \\u00a9 AFP\\/File\\n New Zealand's Prime Minister John Key, pictured during a press conference in Wellington, on November 20, 2014\\n\\n\\nBeijing has reportedly expressed concern at the claims, which are based on documents from US whistleblower Edward Snowden obtained by Auckland's Herald on Sunday newspaper.The newspaper reported that New Zealand intelligence and the US National Security Agency collaborated on a plan to hack a data link between China's consulate in Auckland and a nearby visa office run by the Chinese.It said it was unclear whether the hack went ahead because Snowden fled the NSA in May 2013, before it had come to fruition.State news agency Xinhua said the Chinese embassy in Wellington issued a statement saying it was concerned about the report and attached great importance to cyber security.\\\"We will firmly safeguard our security interests and continue to guarantee our cyber and information security with concrete measures,\\\" it said.\\\"At present, cyber space is riddled with chaos and uncertainty.

Sebelius\\nBurwell v. Hobby Lobby\\nKing v. Burwell\\n\\n\\nThe Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act (PPACA), commonly called the Affordable Care Act (ACA) or \\\"ObamaCare\\\", is a United States federal statute signed into law by President Barack Obama on March 23, 2010. Together with the Health Care and Education Reconciliation Act amendment, it represents the most significant regulatory overhaul of the U.S. healthcare system since the passage of Medicare and Medicaid in 1965.\\nThe ACA was enacted to increase the quality and affordability of health insurance, lower the uninsured rate by expanding public and private insurance coverage, and reduce the costs of healthcare for individuals and the government. It introduced mechanisms like mandates, subsidies, and insurance exchanges.[1][2] The law requires insurance companies to cover all applicants within new minimum standards and offer the same rates regardless of pre-existing conditions or sex.[3] Additional reforms were increased competition, regulation, and incentives to streamline the delivery of healthcare. In 2011 the Congressional Budget Office projected that the ACA would lower both future deficits[4] and Medicare spending.[5]\\nOn June 28, 2012, the United States Supreme Court upheld the constitutionality of the ACA's individual mandate as an exercise of Congress's taxing power[6] in the case National Federation of Independent Business v. Sebelius. However, the Court held that states cannot be forced to participate in the ACA's Medicaid expansion under penalty of losing their current Medicaid funding.[7][8][9] Since the ruling, the law and its implementation have continued to face challenges in Congress and federal courts, and from some state governments, conservative advocacy groups, labor unions, and small business organizations.\\nAs of mid-2015, an additional 11 million Americans gained health insurance coverage under the ACA, and the percentage of uninsured Americans dropped from 18% in 2013 to 11.9%.[10][11]\\n\\n\\n\\nOverview of provisions\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nThe President and White House Staff react to the House of Representatives passing the bill on March 21, 2010.\\n\\n\\nThe Affordable Care Act (ACA)[12][13] or Obamacare,[14] includes numerous provisions that took effect between 2010 and 2020. Policies issued before 2010 are exempted by a grandfather clause from many of the changes to insurance standards, but they were affected by other provisions.[15][16] Significant reforms, most of which took effect on January 1, 2014, include:\\n\\nGuaranteed issue prohibits insurers from denying coverage to individuals due to pre-existing conditions, and a partial community rating requires insurers to offer the same premium price to all applicants of the same age and geographical location without regard to gender or most pre-existing conditions (excluding tobacco use).[17][18][19]\\nMinimum standards for health insurance policies are established.[20][21][22][23][24]\\nAn individual mandate[25][26] requires all individuals not covered by an employer sponsored health plan, Medicaid, Medicare or other public insurance programs (such as Tricare) to secure an approved private-insurance policy or pay a penalty, unless the applicable individual has a financial hardship or is a member of a recognized religious sect exempted by the Internal Revenue Service.[27] The law includes subsidies to help people with low incomes comply with the mandate.[28]\\nHealth insurance exchanges operate as a new avenue by which individuals and small businesses in every state can compare policies and buy insurance (with a government subsidy if eligible).[29] In the first year of operation, open enrollment on the exchanges ran from October 1, 2013 to March 31, 2014. The original purchase deadline date to be covered for January 1, 2014 was December 15, 2013, but the deadline was pushed back, first to December 23, 2013 and later to December 24, 2013.[30][31][32][33] For plans starting in 2015, the proposed enrollment period is November 15, 2014 \\u2013 February 15, 2015.[34]\\nLow-income individuals and families whose incomes are between 100% and 400% of the federal poverty level will receive federal subsidies on a sliding scale if they purchase insurance via an exchange.[35] Those from 133% to 150% of the poverty level will be subsidized such that their premium costs will be 3% to 4% of income.[36] In 2013, the subsidy would apply for incomes up to $45,960 for an individual or $94,200 for a family of four; consumers can choose to receive their tax credits in advance, and the exchange will send the money directly to the insurer every month.[37] Small businesses will be eligible for subsidies.[38]\\nMedicaid eligibility expanded to include individuals and families with incomes up to 133% of the federal poverty level, including adults without disabilities and without dependent children.[39] The law also provides for a 5% \\\"income disregard\\\", making the effective income eligibility limit for Medicaid 138% of the poverty level.[40] Furthermore, the State Children's Health Insurance Program (CHIP) enrollment process is simplified.[39] However, in National Federation of Independent Business v. Sebelius, the Supreme Court ruled that states may opt out of the Medicaid expansion, and several have done so.\\nReforms to the Medicare payment system are meant to promote greater efficiency in the healthcare delivery system by restructuring Medicare reimbursements from fee-for-service to bundled payments.[41][42] Under the new payment system, a single payment is paid to a hospital and a physician group for a defined episode of care (such as a hip replacement) rather than individual payments to individual service providers. In addition, the Medicare Part D coverage gap (commonly called the \\\"donut hole\\\") will shrink incrementally, closing completely by January 1, 2020.[43]\\nBusinesses which employ 50 or more people but do not offer health insurance to their full-time employees will pay a tax penalty if the government has subsidized a full-time employee's healthcare through tax deductions or other means. This is commonly known as the employer mandate.[44][45] In July 2013, the Internal Revenue Service delayed enforcement of this provision for one year.[46]\\n\\nLegislative history\\nBackground\\n\\nThe Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act consists of a combination of measures to control healthcare costs, and an expansion of coverage through public and private insurance: broader Medicaid eligibility and Medicare coverage, and subsidized, regulated private insurance. An individual mandate coupled with subsidies for private insurance as a means for universal healthcare was considered the best way to win the support of the Senate because it had been included in prior bipartisan reform proposals. The concept goes back to at least 1989, when the conservative Heritage Foundation proposed an individual mandate as an alternative to single-payer health care.[47] It was championed for a time by conservative economists and Republican senators as a market-based approach to healthcare reform on the basis of individual responsibility and avoidance of free rider problems. Specifically, because the 1986 Emergency Medical Treatment and Active Labor Act (EMTALA) requires any hospital participating in Medicare (which nearly all do) to provide emergency care to anyone who needs it, the government often indirectly bore the cost of those without the ability to pay.[48][49][50]\\nWhen President Bill Clinton proposed a healthcare reform bill in 1993 that included a mandate for employers to provide health insurance to all employees through a regulated marketplace of health maintenance organizations, Republican Senators proposed an alternative that would have required individuals, but not employers, to buy insurance.[49] Ultimately the Clinton plan failed amid an unprecedented barrage of negative advertising funded by politically conservative groups and the health insurance industry and due to concerns that it was overly complex.[51] After failing to obtain a comprehensive reform of the healthcare system, Clinton negotiated a compromise with the 105th Congress to instead enact the State Children's Health Insurance Program (SCHIP) in 1997.[52]\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nThe 1993 Republican alternative, introduced by Senator John Chafee as the Health Equity and Access Reform Today Act, contained a \\\"universal coverage\\\" requirement with a penalty for noncompliance\\u2014an individual mandate\\u2014as well as subsidies to be used in state-based 'purchasing groups'.[53] Advocates for the 1993 bill included prominent Republicans who today oppose a mandate, such as Senators Orrin Hatch, Chuck Grassley, Bob Bennett, and Kit Bond.[54][55] Of the 43 Republicans Senators from 1993, 20 supported the HEART Act.[47][56] Another Republican proposal, introduced in 1994 by Senator Don Nickles (R-OK), the Consumer Choice Health Security Act, contained an individual mandate with a penalty provision;[57] however, Nickles subsequently removed the mandate from the bill, stating he had decided \\\"that government should not compel people to buy health insurance\\\".[58] At the time of these proposals, Republicans did not raise constitutional issues with the mandate; Mark Pauly, who helped develop a proposal that included an individual mandate for George H.W. Bush, remarked, \\\"I don\\u2019t remember that being raised at all. The way it was viewed by the Congressional Budget Office in 1994 was, effectively, as a tax.\\\"[47]\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nMitt Romney's Massachusetts went from 90% of its residents insured to 98%, the highest rate in the nation.[59]\\n\\n\\nIn 2006, an insurance expansion bill was enacted at the state level in Massachusetts. The bill contained both an individual health insurance mandate and an insurance exchange. Republican Governor Mitt Romney vetoed the mandate, but after Democrats overrode his veto, he signed it into law.[60] Romney's implementation of the 'Health Connector' exchange and individual mandate in Massachusetts was at first lauded by Republicans. During Romney's 2008 presidential campaign, Senator Jim DeMint praised Romney's ability to \\\"take some good conservative ideas, like private health insurance, and apply them to the need to have everyone insured.\\\" Romney said of the individual mandate: \\\"I'm proud of what we've done. If Massachusetts succeeds in implementing it, then that will be the model for the nation.\\\"[61]\\nIn 2007, a year after the Massachusetts reform, Republican Senator Bob Bennett and Democratic Senator Ron Wyden introduced the Healthy Americans Act, which also featured an individual mandate and state-based regulated insurance markets called \\\"State Health Help Agencies\\\".[50][61] The bill initially attracted bipartisan support but died in committee. Many of the sponsors and co-sponsors remained in Congress during the 2008 healthcare debate.[62]\\nBy 2008 many Democrats were considering using this approach as the basis for healthcare reform. Experts have said that the legislation that eventually emerged from Congress in 2009 and 2010 bears many similarities to the 2007 bill[53] and that it was deliberately patterned after Romney's state healthcare plan.[63] Jonathan Gruber, a professor of economics at MIT and an architect of Massachusetts' health care reform who advised the Clinton and Obama presidential campaigns on healthcare issues, served as a technical consultant to the Obama administration, and helped draft the ACA.[64]\\nHealthcare debate, 2008\\u201310\\n\\nHealthcare reform was a major topic of discussion during the 2008 Democratic presidential primaries. As the race narrowed, attention focused on the plans presented by the two leading candidates, Hillary Clinton and the eventual nominee, Barack Obama. Each candidate proposed a plan to cover the approximately 45\\u00a0million Americans estimated to not have health insurance at some point each year. Clinton's plan would have required all Americans to obtain coverage (in effect, an individual mandate), while Obama's provided a subsidy but rejected the use of an individual mandate.[65][66] During the general election, Obama said that fixing healthcare would be one of his top four priorities if he won the presidency.[67]\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nAfter his inauguration, Obama announced to a joint session of Congress in February 2009 his intent to work with Congress to construct a plan for healthcare reform.[68][69] By July, a series of bills were approved by committees within the House of Representatives.[70] On the Senate side, from June to September, the Senate Finance Committee held a series of 31 meetings to develop a healthcare reform bill. This group \\u2014 in particular, Democrats Max Baucus, Jeff Bingaman, and Kent Conrad, and Republicans Mike Enzi, Chuck Grassley, and Olympia Snowe \\u2014 met for more than 60 hours, and the principles that they discussed, in conjunction with the other committees, became the foundation of the Senate's healthcare reform bill.[71][72][73]\\nWith universal healthcare as one of the stated goals of the Obama administration, congressional Democrats and health policy experts like Jonathan Gruber and David Cutler argued that guaranteed issue would require both community rating and an individual mandate to ensure that adverse selection and\\/or \\\"free riding\\\" would not result in an insurance \\\"death spiral\\\";[74] they convinced Obama that this was necessary, and persuaded him to accept congressional proposals that included a mandate.[75] This approach was taken because the president and congressional leaders had concluded that more progressive plans, such as the (single-payer) Medicare for All act, could not obtain filibuster-proof support in the Senate. By deliberately drawing on bipartisan ideas \\u2014 the same basic outline was supported by former Senate majority leaders Howard Baker, Bob Dole, Tom Daschle and George J. Mitchell\\u2014the bill's drafters hoped to increase the chances of garnering the necessary votes for passage.[76][77]\\nHowever, following the adoption of an individual mandate as a central component of the proposed reforms by Democrats, Republicans began to oppose the mandate and threatened to filibuster any bills that contained it.[47] Senate minority leader Mitch McConnell, who led the Republican congressional strategy in responding to the bill, calculated that Republicans should not support the bill, and worked to keep party discipline and prevent defections:[78]\\n\\nIt was absolutely critical that everybody be together because if the proponents of the bill were able to say it was bipartisan, it tended to convey to the public that this is O.K., they must have figured it out.[79]\\n\\nRepublican Senators, including those who had supported previous bills with a similar mandate, began to describe the mandate as \\\"unconstitutional.\\\" Journalist Ezra Klein wrote in The New Yorker that \\\"the end result was ... a policy that once enjoyed broad support within the Republican Party suddenly faced unified opposition.\\\"[50] Reporter Michael Cooper of The New York Times wrote that: \\\"It can be difficult to remember now, given the ferocity with which many Republicans assail it as an attack on freedom, but the provision in President Obama's healthcare law requiring all Americans to buy health insurance has its roots in conservative thinking.\\\"[49][56]\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nThe reform negotiations also attracted a great deal of attention from lobbyists,[80] including deals between certain lobby groups and the advocates of the law to win the support of groups which had opposed past reforms, as in 1993.[81][82] The Sunlight Foundation documented many of the reported ties between \\\"the healthcare lobbyist complex\\\" and politicians in both major parties.[83]\\nDuring the August 2009 summer congressional recess, many members went back to their districts and entertained town hall meetings to solicit public opinion on the proposals. Over the recess, the Tea Party movement organized protests and many conservative groups and individuals targeted congressional town hall meetings to voice their opposition to the proposed reform bills.[69] There were also many threats made against members of Congress over the course of the Congressional debate.[84][85]\\nTo maintain the progress of the legislative process, when Congress returned from recess, in September 2009 President Obama delivered a speech to a joint session of Congress supporting the ongoing Congressional negotiations, to re-emphasize his commitment to reform and again outline his proposals.[86] He acknowledged the polarization of the debate, and quoted a letter from the late Senator Edward \\\"Ted\\\" Kennedy urging on reform: \\\"what we face is above all a moral issue; that at stake are not just the details of policy, but fundamental principles of social justice and the character of our country.\\\"[87] On November 7, the House of Representatives passed the Affordable Health Care for America Act on a 220\\u2013215 vote and forwarded it to the Senate for passage.[69]\\nSenate\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nThe Senate began work on its own proposals while the House was still working on the Affordable Health Care for America Act. Instead, the Senate took up H.R. 3590, a bill regarding housing tax breaks for service members.[88] As the United States Constitution requires all revenue-related bills to originate in the House,[89] the Senate took up this bill since it was first passed by the House as a revenue-related modification to the Internal Revenue Code. The bill was then used as the Senate's vehicle for their healthcare reform proposal, completely revising the content of the bill.[90] The bill as amended would ultimately incorporate elements of proposals that were reported favorably by the Senate Health and Finance committees. With the Republican minority in the Senate vowing to filibuster any bill they did not support, requiring a cloture vote to end debate, 60 votes would be necessary to get passage in the Senate.[91] At the start of the 111th Congress, Democrats had only 58 votes; the Senate seat in Minnesota ultimately won by Al Franken was still undergoing a recount, and Arlen Specter was still a Republican.\\nTo reach 60 votes, negotiations were undertaken to satisfy the demands of moderate Democrats, and to try to bring several Republican senators aboard; particular attention was given to Bob Bennett, Mike Enzi, Chuck Grassley, and Olympia Snowe. Negotiations continued even after July 7 \\u2014 when Franken was sworn into office, and by which time Specter had switched parties \\u2014 due to disagreements over the substance of the bill, which was still being drafted in committee, and because moderate Democrats hoped to win bipartisan support. Then, on August 25, before the bill could come up for a vote, Ted Kennedy\\u2014a longtime healthcare reform advocate\\u2014died, depriving Democrats of their 60th vote. Before Kennedy's seat was filled, attention was drawn to Snowe because of her vote in favor of the draft bill in the Finance Committee on October 15, but she explicitly stated that this did not mean she would support the final bill.[74] Paul Kirk was appointed as Senator Kennedy's temporary replacement on September 24.\\nAfter the Finance Committee vote, negotiations turned to the demands of moderate Democrats, whose votes would be necessary to break the anticipated Republican filibuster. Majority leader Harry Reid focused on satisfying the Democratic caucus's centrist members until the holdouts came down to Joe Lieberman of Connecticut, an independent who caucused with Democrats, and Ben Nelson, a conservative Democrat, representing Nebraska. Lieberman, despite intense negotiations with Reid in search of a compromise, refused to support a public option, agreeing to vote for the bill only if the provision were not included,[74][92] although it had majority support in Congress. His demand was met.[93] There was debate among the bill's supporters over the importance of the public option,[94] although the vast majority of supporters concluded it was a minor part of the reform overall,[92] and Congressional Democrats' fight for it won various concessions, including conditional waivers allowing states to set up state-based public options such as Vermont's Green Mountain Care.[93][95]\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nSenate vote by state.\\n\\u00a0\\u00a0Democratic yes (58)\\n\\u00a0\\u00a0Independent yes (2)\\n\\u00a0\\u00a0Republican no (39)\\n\\u00a0\\u00a0Republican not voting (1)\\n\\n\\n\\nWith every other Democrat now in favor and every Republican now opposed, the White House and Reid moved on to addressing Nelson's concerns in order to win filibuster-proof support for the bill;[96] they had by this point concluded \\\"it was a waste of time dealing with [Snowe]\\\"[97] because, after her vote for the draft bill in the Finance Committee, she had come under intense pressure from the Republican Senate leadership.[98] After a final 13-hour negotiation, Nelson's support for the bill was won with two concessions: a compromise on abortion, modifying the language of the bill \\\"to give states the right to prohibit coverage of abortion within their own insurance exchanges\\\", which would require consumers to pay for the procedure out of pocket if the state so decided; and an amendment to offer a higher rate of Medicaid reimbursement for Nebraska.[69][99] The latter half of the compromise was derisively called the \\\"Cornhusker Kickback\\\"[100] and was repealed in the subsequent reconciliation amendment bill.\\nOn December 23, the Senate voted 60\\u201339 to end debate on the bill: a cloture vote to end the filibuster. The bill then passed, also 60\\u201339, on December 24, 2009, with all Democrats and two independents voting for it, and all Republicans against (except Jim Bunning, who did not vote).[101] The bill was endorsed by the AMA and AARP.[102]\\nSeveral weeks later, on January 19, 2010, Massachusetts Republican Scott Brown was elected to the Senate in a special election to replace the late Ted Kennedy, having campaigned on giving the Republican minority the 41st vote needed to sustain Republican filibusters.[69][103][104] The special election had become significant to the reform debate because of its effects on the legislative process. The first was psychological: the symbolic importance of losing Kennedy's traditionally Democratic Massachusetts seat made many Congressional Democrats concerned about the political cost of passing a bill.[105][106] The second effect was more practical: the loss of the Democratic supermajority complicated reform proponents' legislative strategy.[106]\\nHouse\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nHouse vote by congressional district.\\n\\u00a0\\u00a0Democratic yea (219)\\n\\u00a0\\u00a0Democratic nay (34)\\n\\u00a0\\u00a0Republican nay (178)\\n\\u00a0\\u00a0No representative seated (4)\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nPresident Obama signing the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act on March 23, 2010.\\n\\n\\nBrown's election meant Democrats could no longer break a filibuster in the Senate. In response, White House Chief of Staff Rahm Emanuel argued that Democrats should scale back to a less ambitious bill; House Speaker Nancy Pelosi pushed back, dismissing Emanuel's scaled-down approach as \\\"Kiddie Care.\\\"[107][108] Obama also remained insistent on comprehensive reform, and the news that Anthem Blue Cross in California intended to raise premium rates for its patients by as much as 39% gave him a new line of argument to reassure nervous Democrats after Scott Brown's win.[107][108] On February 22, President Obama laid out a \\\"Senate-leaning\\\" proposal to consolidate the bills.[109] He held a meeting with both parties' leaders on February 25. With Democrats having lost a filibuster-proof supermajority in the Senate but having already passed the Senate bill with 60 votes on December 24, comprehensive reform proponents' most workable option was for the House to abandon its bill, the Affordable Health Care for America Act, and pass the Senate's bill, the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act, instead.\\nVarious health policy experts encouraged the House to pass the Senate version,[110] but House Democrats were not happy with it and had expected to be able to negotiate changes in a House-Senate conference before passing a final bill.[106] With that option off the table, since any bill that emerged from conference that differed from the Senate bill would have to be passed in the Senate despite another Republican filibuster, most House Democrats agreed to pass the Senate bill on condition that it be amended by a subsequent bill.[106] They drafted the Health Care and Education Reconciliation Act, which could be passed by the reconciliation process.[107][111][112]\\nUnlike rules under regular order, as per the Congressional Budget Act of 1974, reconciliation cannot be subject to a filibuster. But reconciliation is limited to budget changes, which is why the procedure was not used to pass the ACA in the first place; the bill had inherently non-budgetary regulations.[113][114] Still, although the already passed Senate bill could not have been passed by reconciliation, most of House Democrats' demands were budgetary: \\\"these changes\\u2014higher subsidy levels, different kinds of taxes to pay for them, nixing the Nebraska Medicaid deal\\u2014mainly involve taxes and spending. In other words, they're exactly the kinds of policies that are well-suited for reconciliation.\\\"[111]\\nThe remaining obstacle was a pivotal group of pro-life Democrats led by Bart Stupak who were initially reluctant to support the bill. The group found the possibility of federal funding for abortion significant enough to warrant opposition. The Senate bill had not included language that satisfied their abortion concerns, but they could not include additional such language in the reconciliation bill as it would be non-budgetary and thus outside the process's domain. Instead, Obama issued Executive Order 13535, reaffirming the principles in the Hyde Amendment.[115] This won the support of Stupak and members of his group and assured the bill's passage.[112][116] The House passed the Senate bill with a 219\\u2013212 vote on March 21, 2010, with 34 Democrats and all 178 Republicans voting against it.[117] The next day, Republicans introduced legislation to repeal the bill.[118] Obama signed the ACA into law on March 23, 2010.[119] The amendment bill, The Health Care and Education Reconciliation Act, was also passed by the House on March 21; the Senate passed it by reconciliation on March 25, and Obama signed it on March 30.\\nImpact\\nPublic policy\\nThe Affordable Care Act represents the most significant regulatory overhaul of the U.S. healthcare system since the passage of Medicare and Medicaid in 1965.[120] The New York Times summarized the overall impact of the Affordable Care Act on a variety of dimensions during October 2014. The number of uninsured persons has been reduced significantly. About 7.3 million people remain enrolled in private coverage through the online marketplaces; 85% of those qualified for federal subsidies to help pay premiums. For those who qualified for subsidies through the federal exchange, the subsidies lowered the cost by 76% on average. Middle-income persons who don't qualify for subsidies are more likely to have challenges with premium costs. It is too early to tell whether the Act has affected health outcomes. While healthcare costs have grown slower in recent years, the effect of ACA on this trend is unclear. The healthcare industry has generally been helped by the law, due to the additional customers the law created for it.[121]\\nChange in number of uninsured\\n\\nThe ACA has two primary mechanisms for increasing insurance coverage: expanding Medicaid eligibility to include individuals within 138% of the federal poverty level,[40] and creating state-based insurance exchanges where individuals and small business can buy health insurance plans\\u2014those individuals with incomes between 100% and 400% of the federal poverty level will be eligible for subsidies to do so.[29][35] The Congressional Budget Office (CBO) originally estimated that the legislation will reduce the number of uninsured residents by 32\\u00a0million, leaving 23\\u00a0million uninsured residents in 2019 after the bill's provisions have all taken effect.[122][123][124] With the elderly covered by Medicare, the CBO estimate projected that the law would raise the proportion of insured non-elderly citizens from 83% to 94%.[122] A July 2012 CBO estimate raised the expected number of uninsured by 3 million, reflecting the successful legal challenge to the ACA's expansion of Medicaid.[125][126]\\nAmong the people who will remain uninsured:\\n\\nACA drafters believed that increasing insurance coverage would not only improve quality of life but also help reduce medical bankruptcies (currently the leading cause of bankruptcy in America[129]) and job lock.[130] In addition, many believed that expanding coverage would help ensure that the cost controls successfully function; healthcare providers could more easily adapt to payment system reforms that incentivize value over quantity if their costs were partially offset\\u2014for example, hospitals having to do less charity care or insurers having larger and more stable risk pools to distribute costs over.[131]\\nDue to the new regulations of guaranteed issue, and allowing children to be included on their parents' plans until age 26, several insurance companies announced that they would stop issuing new child-only policies.[132][133][134] However, because children would now be covered by their parents' plans, the Census Bureau found that the number of uninsured 19- to 25-year-olds had declined by 1.6% or 393,000 people by 2011.[135] Starting January 1, 2014, state health insurance exchanges will be required to offer a child-only coverage option, and Medicaid eligibility will be made available to 16 million individuals with incomes below 133% of the federal poverty level.[136]\\nUnder the law, those workers whose employers offer \\\"affordable coverage\\\" will not be eligible for subsidies in the exchanges. To be eligible, per the law's definition, the cost of employer-based health insurance must exceed 9.5% of the worker\\u2019s household income. In January 2013 the Internal Revenue Service ruled that only the cost of covering the individual employee would be considered in determining whether the cost of coverage exceeded 9.5% of income. However, the cost of a family plan is often higher, but the ruling means that those higher costs will not be considered even if the extra premiums push the cost of coverage above the 9.5% income threshold. The New York Times said this could leave 2\\u20134 million Americans unable to afford family coverage under their employers\\u2019 plans and ineligible for subsidies to buy coverage elsewhere.[137][138]\\nMultiple 2014 studies and surveys indicated that the number of uninsured had fallen due to expanded Medicaid eligibility and health insurance exchanges established due to PPACA. These changes took effect January 1, 2014. The Commonwealth Fund reported in July 2014 that an additional 9.5 million people aged 19\\u201364 had obtained health insurance, roughly 5% of the working-aged population.[139] Gallup reported in July 2014 that the uninsured rate among adults 18 and over fell from 18.0% in Q3 2013 to 13.4% by Q2 2014.[140] The Rand Corporation reported that by March 2014: \\\"Enrollment in employer-sponsored insurance plans increased by 8.2 million and Medicaid enrollment increased by 5.9 million, although some individuals did lose coverage during this period. The authors also found that 3.9 million people are now covered through the state and federal marketplaces \\u2014 the so called insurance exchanges \\u2014 and less than 1 million people who previously had individual-market insurance became uninsured during the period in question. While the survey cannot tell if this latter group lost their insurance due to cancellation or because they simply felt the cost was too high, the overall number is very small, representing less than 1 percent of people between the ages of 18 and 64.\\\"[141] Thereafter, data from August 2014 showed that 7.3 million people had enrolled through the marketplace and paid their premiums.[142]\\nInsurance exchanges and the individual mandate\\n\\n\\nThe Act establishes state-based health insurance exchanges. The exchanges are regulated, online marketplaces, administered by either federal or state government, where individuals and small business can purchase private insurance plans starting October 1, 2013, with coverage beginning January 1, 2014.[29][143][144] Individuals with incomes between 100% and 400% of the federal poverty level who purchase insurance plans via an exchange will be eligible to receive federal subsidies to help pay premium costs.[28][35]\\nThe exchanges will take the form of websites where the private plans allowed on sale within them will be regulated and comparable: Consumers will be able to visit these websites or ring a call center, compare the plans on offer, fill out a form to the government that will be used to determine their eligibility for subsidies, and then purchase the insurance of their choice from the options available during limited open enrollment periods.[145] The first open enrollment period will last from October 1, 2013 to March 31, 2014, after which time uninsured individuals generally may not purchase insurance through an exchange until the following open enrollment period. In subsequent years, the open enrollment period will start on October 15 and end on December 7.[146][147] Despite some controversy, Members of Congress and their staff will participate in this system: they are required to obtain health insurance through the exchanges or plans otherwise approved by the bill (such as Medicare) instead of the Federal Employees Health Benefits Program that they currently use.[148]\\nThe insurance exchanges are a method designed to create a market for private insurance in a way that addresses market failures, such as the high number of uninsured, medical bankruptcies, coverage limits, unaffordability, and inflation[149] through regulation:[150][92] Only approved plans that meet certain standards will be allowed to be sold on the exchanges, and insurers will be prohibited from denying insurance to consumers on the basis of pre-existing conditions.[17][18] Several methods will be employed to make these plans affordable: Subsidies will be provided to those eligible.[35][38] Regulations intended to reduce prices through competition will make plans and prices more transparent and price comparisons more accessible for consumers with online information;[151][152][153] and federally approved, multi-state plans will be phased-into state exchanges[154] to help guarantee enough options.[155] And price regulations will be implemented, including a minimum medical loss ratio,[156] and partial community rating that prevents price discrimination from pricing individuals out of the market through unaffordable plans or premium increases on the insured[144][157]\\u2014namely poor and sick individuals who are more expensive to cover for insurers motivated either by profit maximization and\\/or the economics of insurance; specifically, the risk of an insurance pool not providing enough net-premiums to offset net-pay-outs.[158]\\nThese regulations are enabled to function due to the individual mandate[25] \\u2014 the requirement to buy insurance or pay a penalty\\u2014and the limits on open enrollment,[147][159] without which healthy people might put-off insuring themselves until they got sick. In such a situation, insurers would have to raise their premiums to afford the remaining (relatively sicker and thus more expensive) population,[25][160][161] which could create a vicious cycle in which more and more people drop their coverage \\u2013 a result known as an insurance death spiral.[162] Alternatively, the process could settle at a stable equilibrium relying on relatively high premiums for the insured and less coverage (and thus more illness and medical bankruptcy) for the uninsured.[157][160][163] The absence of the Mandate would have likely caused the exchanges as a whole to malfunction, and ultimately perform similarly to the current private insurance market, according to its supporters,[164][165] based on studies by the CBO, Jonathan Gruber, and Rand Health have concluded.[166][167][168] Conversely, the inclusion of the mandate increases the size and diversity of the insured population, broadening the risk pool to spread the cost of insurance in a sustainable manner.[169] Policy experience in New Jersey on the one hand and Massachusetts on the other offers evidence of such divergent outcomes.[157][167][170] In September 2012, the Congressional Budget Office estimated that nearly six million will pay the penalty in 2016.[171][172]\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nHealth insurance exchanges by state.[173]\\n\\u00a0\\u00a0Creating state-operated exchanges\\n\\u00a0\\u00a0Establishing state-federal partnership exchanges\\n\\u00a0\\u00a0Defaulting to federal exchange\\n\\n\\n\\nUnder the law, setting up an exchange gives a state partial discretion on standards and prices of insurance, aside from those specifics set-out in the ACA.[174][175] For example, those administering the exchange will be able to determine which plans are sold on or excluded from the exchanges, and adjust (through limits on and negotiations with private insurers) the prices on offer. They will also be able to impose higher or state-specific coverage requirements\\u2014including whether plans offered in the state are prohibited from covering abortion (making the procedure an out-of-pocket expense) or mandated to cover abortions that a physician determines is medically necessary; in either case, federal subsidies are prohibited from being used to fund the procedure.[176][177] If a state does not set up an exchange itself, they lose that discretion, and the responsibility to set up exchanges for such states defaults to the federal government, whereby the Department of Health and Human Services assumes the authority and legal obligation to operate all functions in these federally facilitated exchanges.[174] As of May 2013, 23 states and the District of Columbia plan to operate state-based exchanges themselves, seven of which will do so in partnership with the federal government\\u2014an arrangement where they retain discretionary management but the federal government executes various functions. The remaining 27 states default to federally facilitated exchanges.[173]\\nThe law is also designed to be flexible by allowing states, from 2017 onwards, to apply for a \\\"waiver for state innovation\\\" from the federal government that allows them to experiment with their own state-based system, on condition that it meets certain criteria.[178] To obtain a waiver, a state must pass legislation setting up an alternative health system that provides insurance at least as comprehensive and as affordable as that the ACA would, covers at least as many residents, and does not increase the federal deficit.[179] Provided a state meets these conditions, receiving a waiver can exempt states from some of the central requirements of the ACA, including the individual mandate, the provision of an insurance exchange, and the employer mandate.[180] The state would also receive compensation equal to the aggregate amount of any federal subsidies and tax credits for which its residents and employers would have been eligible under the ACA plan, if they cannot be paid out due to the structure of the state plan.[178]\\nIn May 2011, Vermont, a state in which Republicans are but a small minority, had enacted Green Mountain Care, a state-based single-payer system for which they intended to pursue a waiver to implement.[181][182][183] In December 2014, Vermont decided not to pursue the single-payer system.[184]\\nImplementation\\nMain article: HealthCare.gov\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nEarly implementation efforts for the healthcare exchanges, especially the exchanges operated by the federal government, have received nearly universally negative reactions in the media and from politicians.[185][186][187] HealthCare.gov, the website that allows people to apply for insurance through the exchanges operated by the federal government, crashed on opening and suffered from a rash of problems throughout the first month.[188] Many users have also found the available plans to be unattractive.[189][190][191][192] Ongoing problems with the website have prompted the development of HealthSherpa, an independently produced alternative to HealthCare.gov, that contains consumer information.[193][194]\\nVarious committees in both chambers of Congress have conducted hearings where cyber security concerns related to HealthCare.gov have been discussed. Experts disagree over the extent HealthCare.gov is vulnerable to cyber attacks.[195][196][197][198]\\nAs of March 2013, \\\"radio ads providing information on the Affordable Care Act\\\" have been broadcast in Ojibwe, Yupik, Inupiat, Lakota and Navajo, according to Indian Country Today Media Network.[199]\\nThe House Energy and Commerce Committee reported on April 30, 2014, that 67% of individuals and families who had selected a health plan in the Federally Facilitated Marketplace had paid their first month\\u2019s premium; and that 25% of paid enrollees are ages 18 to 34.[200] On the same day, Committee ranking member Henry A. Waxman issued a statement saying the reporting was \\\"... inaccurate, irresponsible, and out-of-date\\\" accompanied by a memorandum detailing the basis behind his statement.[201] A week later, representatives for top health insurance companies told members of Congress that more than 80 percent of people who've signed up under the new health care law have gone on to pay their premiums.[202]\\nOn July 30, 2014, the Government Accountability Office released a non-partisan study that concluded the administration did not provide \\\"effective planning or oversight practices\\\" in developing the HealthCare.gov website.[203]\\nChange in insurance standards\\nThe ACA includes regulations that set standards for insurance,[20] some specified in the law, others subsequently established by the Secretary of Health and Human Services. Among these new standards are a ban on the ability to drop policyholders if they become sick,[204] a ban on price discrimination on the basis of pre-existing conditions or sex through a partial community rating,[205] and allowing children and dependents to remain on their parents' insurance plan until their 26th birthday.[206][207]\\nUnder the law's authorization, Secretary of Health Kathleen Sebelius issued a set of defined \\\"essential health benefits\\\"[21] that all new insurance plans have to include. Insurers are prohibited from imposing annual or lifetime coverage caps on these essential benefits.[204][208] These cover: \\\"ambulatory patient services; emergency services; hospitalization; maternity and newborn care; mental health and substance use disorder services, including behavioral health treatment; prescription drugs; rehabilitative and habilitative services and devices; laboratory services; preventive and wellness services and chronic disease management; and pediatric services, including oral and vision care.\\\"[209][210] In determining what would qualify as an essential benefit, the law requires that the scope of standard benefits should equal that of a \\\"typical employer plan.\\\"[209] States have some discretion in determining what should be considered the benchmark plan within the requirements of the law, and may include services beyond those set out by the Secretary.[211]\\nAmong the essential health benefits, preventive care, childhood immunizations and adult vaccinations, and medical screenings are covered by an insurance plan's premiums, and cannot be subject to any co-payments, co-insurance, or deductibles.[212][213] Specific examples of such services covered include: mammograms and colonoscopies, wellness visits, gestational diabetes screening, HPV testing, STI counseling, HIV screening and counseling, FDA-approved contraceptive methods, breastfeeding support and supplies, and domestic violence screening and counseling.[214]\\n In addition, the law established four tiers of coverage: bronze, silver, gold, and platinum. All categories offer the same set of essential health benefits. What the categories specify is the division of premiums and out-of-pocket costs: bronze plans will have the lowest monthly premiums and highest out-of-pocket costs, and vice versa for platinum plans.[209][215] The percentages of health care costs that plans are expected to cover through premiums (as opposed to out-of-pocket costs) are, on average: 60% (bronze), 70% (silver), 80% (gold), and 90% (platinum).[216]\\nInsurers are also required to implement an appeals process for coverage determination and claims on all new plans.[204] They are also required to spend at least 80\\u201385% of premium dollars on health costs and claims instead of administrative costs and profits; rebates must be issued to policyholders if this is violated.[217][218]\\nCoverage for contraceptives\\n\\nOne provision in the law mandates that health insurance cover \\\"additional preventive care and screenings\\\" for women, as specified in regulations to be issued by the Health Resources and Services Administration (HRSA).[219] The HRSA guidelines, issued August 1, 2011, included in this mandate \\\"[a]ll Food and Drug Administration approved contraceptive methods, sterilization procedures, and patient education and counseling for all women with reproductive capacity\\\".[220] This mandate applies to all employers and educational institutions except for religious organizations.[221][222] These regulations were included on the recommendations of the Institute of Medicine, which concluded that access to contraception is medically necessary \\\"to ensure women's health and well-being.\\\"[223][224]\\nThe initial regulations proved controversial among certain religious groups, most notably evangelicals and Lutherans, and especially the Roman Catholic hierarchy, whose hospitals, charities and educational institutions of higher learning, as well as other enterprises, oppose contraception on doctrinal grounds.[225] To accommodate those concerns while still guaranteeing access to contraception, the regulations were adjusted to \\\"allow religious organizations to opt out of the requirement to include birth control coverage in their employee insurance plans. In those instances, the insurers themselves will offer contraception coverage to enrollees directly, at no additional cost.\\\"[226]\\nThe contraception rule has also been challenged by corporations as a burden against their religious expression. The first challenge to reach the Supreme Court was Burwell v. Hobby Lobby.[227] The Court ruled that closely held corporations, such as Hobby Lobby, would be exempt from the contraception rule under the Religious Freedom Restoration Act, which applies to regulations that govern the activities of closely held for-profit corporations.[228] In a follow up case to Burwell v. Hobby Lobby the U.S. Supreme Court issued an injunction pending appeal under which an evangelical college in Illinois and other religiously affiliated nonprofit groups will not have to fill out a form offered to religious nonprofits that would effectively transfer the cost of its employees\\u2019 contraceptives to insurers. Wheaton College argued that filling out the form would \\u201ctrigger\\u201d emergency contraceptive coverage and is therefore still against the institution\\u2019s religious beliefs.[229][230][231][232][233][234]\\nEffects on insurance premiums\\nSeveral studies on insurance premiums expect that with the subsidies offered under the ACA, more people will pay less (than they did prior to the reforms) than those who will pay more, and that those premiums will be more stable (even in changing health circumstances) and transparent, due to the regulations on insurance.[235][236][237] The Kaiser Family Foundation has calculated that about half the people who currently buy insurance on their own today will be eligible for subsidies. Among those receiving subsidies (which excludes those with incomes above four times the poverty line \\u2014 about $46,000 for individuals or $94,000 for a family of four), the subsidies are projected to be worth an average of $5,548 per household, which would effectively discount the projected price of insurance by two-thirds, on average.[238] For individuals, NPR and the Kaiser Family Foundation collaborated to produce a quick online calculator for people to estimate their premiums and subsidy amount, based on where they live, income, and family size.[237]\\nFor the effect on health insurance premiums, the CBO forecast that by 2016 the individual market would comprise 17% of the market, and that premiums per person would increase by 10% to 13% but that over half of these individuals would receive subsidies that would decrease the premium paid to \\\"well below\\\" premiums charged under current law.[239][240] It also forecast that for the small group market, 13% of the market, premiums would be impacted 1% to \\u22123%, and \\u22128% to \\u221211% for those receiving subsidies; for the large group market comprising 70% of the market, premiums would be impacted 0% to \\u22123%, with those under high premium plans subject to excise taxes being charged \\u22129% to \\u221212% less. Factors taken into account by this analysis included: increased benefits particularly for the individual market, more healthy policyholders due to the mandate, administrative efficiencies related to the health exchanges, and high-premium insurance plans reducing some benefits in response to the tax.[240] As of September 2013, the final projections of the average monthly premium scheduled to be offered in the exchanges came in below CBO expectations, reducing expected costs not only for consumers but also for the government by reducing the overall cost of the subsidies.[241][242][243][244]\\nLarry Levitt, a health policy analyst from the Kaiser Family Foundation, noted that the individual market compromises a relatively small share of those under 65, and said, in contrast, \\\"I don't think anyone expects significant [cost] increases in the employer market,\\\" where the majority of Americans get their health insurance. Secretary of Health and Human Services Kathleen Sebelius also indicated that some cost increase in the individual market was expected because the standard of insurance allowed in the insurance exchanges would be higher quality than that generally available currently (and thus more expensive), and that the government subsidies provided to make insurance affordable are intended to more than offset this effect.[245]\\nIn June 2013, a study by the Kaiser Family Foundation focused on actual experience under the Act as it affected individual market consumers (those buying insurance on their own). The study found that the Medical Loss Ratio provision of the Act had saved this group of consumers $1.2 billion in 2011 and $2.1 billion in 2012, reducing their 2012 costs by 7.5%.[156] The bulk of the savings were in reduced premiums for individual insurance, but some came from premium rebates paid to consumers by insurance companies that had failed to meet the requirements of the Act. The Associated Press reported that, as a result of ACA's provisions closing the Medicare Part D coverage gap (between the \\\"initial coverage limit\\\" and the \\\"catastrophic coverage threshold\\\" in the prescription drug program), individuals formerly falling in this \\\"donut hole\\\" would save about 40 percent.[246] Almost all [clarification needed] of the savings came reportedly because, with regard to brand-name drugs, ACA secured a discount from pharmaceutical companies.[246] The change benefited more than two million people, most of them in the middle class.[246]\\nHealthcare cost inflation\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nU.S. healthcare cost inflation from 2000 to 2011.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nU.S. healthcare costs as a percentage of GDP from 2000 to 2011.\\n\\n\\nIn a May 2010 presentation on \\\"Health Costs and the Federal Budget\\\", the CBO stated that \\\"Rising health costs will put tremendous pressure on the federal budget during the next few decades and beyond. In CBO's judgment, the health legislation enacted earlier this year does not substantially diminish that pressure.\\\"[247]\\nThe CBO further observed that \\\"Putting the federal budget on a sustainable path would almost certainly require a significant reduction in the growth of federal health spending relative to current law (including this year's health legislation).\\\"[247] and concluded,\\n\\n... there is considerable agreement that a substantial share of current spending on health care contributes little if anything to people's health, and providers and health analysts are making significant efforts to make the health system more efficient... [though] it is not clear what specific policies the federal government can adopt to generate fundamental changes in the health system; that is, it is not clear what specific policies would translate the potential for significant cost savings into reality.[247]\\n\\nJonathan Cohn, a health policy analyst, commented:\\n\\nCBO doesn't produce estimates of how reform will affect overall health care spending \\u2014 that is, the amount of money our society, as a whole, will devote to health care. But the official actuary for Medicare does. The actuary determined that ... the long-term trend is towards less spending: Inflation after ten years would be lower than it is now. And it's the long-term trend that matters most ... [The Affordable Care Act] will reduce the cost of care\\u2014not by a lot and not by as much as possible in theory, but as much as is possible in this political universe.[131][248]\\n\\nHe and fellow The New Republic editor Noam Scheiber claimed the CBO did not include in its estimate various cost-saving provisions intended to reduce health inflation,[249] also positing that the CBO has a history of consistently underestimating the impact of health legislation.[250]\\nJonathan Gruber, a consultant who helped develop both the Massachusetts healthcare reform under Mitt Romney and the ACA,[64] has acknowledged that the ACA is not guaranteed to significantly \\\"bend the curve\\\" of rising healthcare costs:[251]\\n\\nThe real question is how far the ACA will go in slowing cost growth. Here, there is great uncertainty\\u2014mostly because there is such uncertainty in general about how to control cost growth in health care. There is no shortage of good ideas for ways of doing so ... There is, however, a shortage of evidence regarding which approaches will actually work\\u2014and therefore no consensus on which path is best to follow. In the face of such uncertainty, the ACA pursued the path of considering a range of different approaches to controlling health care costs ... Whether these policies by themselves can fully solve the long run health care cost problem in the United States is doubtful. They may, however, provide a first step towards controlling costs\\u2014and understanding what does and does not work to do so more broadly.[252]\\n\\nThe law created the Center for Medicare and Medicaid Innovation and requires numerous pilot programs and demonstrations that may affect healthcare costs.[253] These cost reductions were not factored into CBO cost estimates.[254]\\nThe Business Roundtable, an association of CEOs, commissioned a report from the consulting company Hewitt Associates which found that the legislation \\\"could potentially reduce that trend line by more than $3,000 per employee, to $25,435,\\\" with respect to insurance premiums. It also stated that the legislation \\\"could potentially reduce the rate of future health care cost increases by 15% to 20% when fully phased in by 2019.\\\" The group cautioned that all of this would be dependent upon the success of the cost-saving government pilot programs which must then be wholly copied in the private market.[255]\\nThe Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services reported in 2013 that, while costs per capita continue to rise, the rate of increase in annual healthcare costs has fallen since 2002. Per capita cost increases have averaged 5.4% annually since 2000. Costs relative to GDP, which had been rising, have stagnated since 2009.[256] Several studies have attempted to explain the reduction in the rate of annual increase. Reasons include, among others:\\n\\nHigher unemployment due to the 2008-2010 recession, which has limited the ability of consumers to purchase healthcare;\\nOut-of-pocket payments, and deductibles, which constitute the amount an individual pays for their health costs before insurance begins to cover claims, have risen. These rising costs generally cause less consumption of healthcare services.[257] The proportion of workers with employer-sponsored health insurance requiring a deductible climbed to about three-quarters in 2012 from about half in 2006.[258][259]\\nStructural changes[258] in the healthcare system made by the ACA that aim to shift the healthcare system from paying-for-quantity to paying-for-quality. Examples include incentives to reduce hospital infections and to use electronic medical records, accountable care organizations, and bundled payments to coordinate care and prioritize quality over quantity.[260] Some of these changes have occurred due to healthcare providers acting in anticipation of future implementation of reforms.[260][261]\\n\\nUncertainty exists about the extent to which each factor is responsible for the recent reduction in health inflation, and about the durability of the overall trend, including the accompanying reduction in long-term deficit projections due to reduced healthcare costs. However, several studies found that the temporary effects of the recession cannot account for the entirety of the slowdown and that structural changes likely share at least partial credit.[258][261][262][263]\\nOne study estimated that the changes to the health system are responsible for about a quarter of the recent reduction in inflation.[264] Paul Krawzak posits that even if cost controls succeed in reducing the amount spent on healthcare, such efforts on their own may be insufficient to outweigh the long-term burden placed by demographic changes, particularly the growth of the population on Medicare.[265]\\nFederal deficit\\nCBO estimates of revenue and impact on deficit\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nCBO: Deficit reduction under the ACA; the \\\"bump\\\" is from the coverage expansion starting 2014[266]\\n\\n\\nThe 2011 comprehensive CBO estimate projected a net deficit reduction of more than $200 billion during the 2012\\u20132021 period:[267][268] it calculated the law would result in $604 billion in total outlays offset by $813 billion in total receipts, resulting in a $210 billion net reduction in the deficit.[267] The CBO separately noted that while most of the spending provisions do not begin until 2014,[269][270] revenue will still exceed spending in those subsequent years.[271] The CBO averred that the bill would \\\"substantially reduce the growth of Medicare's payment rates for most services; impose an excise tax on insurance plans with relatively high premiums; and make various other changes to the federal tax code, Medicare, Medicaid, and other programs\\\"[239]\\u2014ultimately extending the solvency of the Medicare trust fund by 8 years.[272]\\nHowever, this estimate was made prior to the Supreme Court's ruling that enabled states to opt out of the Medicaid expansion, thereby forgoing the federal funding. The CBO and JCT subsequently updated the budget projection, estimating the impact of the ruling would reduce the cost estimate of the insurance coverage provisions by $84 billion.[124][273][274]\\nMajor sources of deficit reduction include:[212] higher Medicare taxes on the wealthy; new annual fees on health insurance providers; similar fees on the healthcare industry such as manufacturers and importers of brand-name pharmaceutical drugs and certain medical devices; limits on tax deductions of medical expenses and flexible spending accounts; a new 40% excise tax on \\\"Cadillac\\\" insurance policies - plans with annual insurance premiums in excess of $10,200 for an individual or $27,500 for a family; revenue from mandate penalty payments; a 10% federal sales tax on indoor tanning services; and spending offsets such as a reduction in Medicare reimbursements to insurers and drug companies for private Medicare Advantage policies that the Government Accountability Office and Medicare Payment Advisory Commission found to be overpaid (relative to government Medicare);[275][276] and reductions in Medicare reimbursements to hospitals that do not meet standards of efficiency and care.[275]\\nAlthough the CBO generally does not provide cost estimates beyond the 10-year budget projection period because of the degree of uncertainty involved in the projection, it decided to do so in this case at the request of lawmakers, and estimated a second decade deficit reduction of $1.2\\u00a0trillion.[239][277] CBO predicted deficit reduction around a broad range of one-half percent of GDP over the 2020s while cautioning that \\\"a wide range of changes could occur\\\".[278]\\nA commonly heard complaint regarding the CBO cost estimates is that CBO was required to exclude from its initial estimates the effects of likely \\\"doc fix\\\" legislation that would increase Medicare payments by more than $200\\u00a0billion from 2010 to 2019.[279][280][281] However, the \\\"doc fix\\\" is a separate issue that would have existed whether or not the ACA became law - omitting its cost from the ACA is no different from omitting the cost of the Bush tax cuts.[282][283][284]\\nOpinions on CBO projections\\nThere was mixed opinion about the CBO estimates. Uwe Reinhardt, a health economist at Princeton, wrote that \\\"The rigid, artificial rules under which the Congressional Budget Office must score proposed legislation unfortunately cannot produce the best unbiased forecasts of the likely fiscal impact of any legislation\\\", but went on to say \\\"But even if the budget office errs significantly in its conclusion that the bill would actually help reduce the future federal deficit, I doubt that the financing of this bill will be anywhere near as fiscally irresponsible as was the financing of the Medicare Modernization Act of 2003.\\\"[285] Douglas Holtz-Eakin, CBO director during the George W. Bush administration, who later served as the chief economic policy adviser to U.S. Senator John McCain's 2008 presidential campaign, alleged that the bill would increase the deficit by $562\\u00a0billion because, he argued, it front-loaded revenue and back-loaded benefits.[286]\\nThe New Republic editors Noam Scheiber and Jonathan Cohn, countered critical assessments of the law's deficit impact, arguing that it is as likely, if not more so, for predictions to have underestimated deficit reduction than to have overestimated it. They noted that it is easier, for example, to account for the cost of definite levels of subsidies to specified numbers of people than account for savings from preventive healthcare, and that the CBO has a track record of consistently overestimating the costs of, and underestimating the savings of health legislation;[249][250] \\\"innovations in the delivery of medical care, like greater use of electronic medical records[287] and financial incentives for more coordination of care among doctors, would produce substantial savings while also slowing the relentless climb of medical expenses... But the CBO would not consider such savings in its calculations, because the innovations hadn't really been tried on such large scale or in concert with one another\\u2014and that meant there wasn't much hard data to prove the savings would materialize.\\\"[249]\\nDavid Walker, former U.S. Comptroller General now working for The Peter G. Peterson Foundation, has stated that the CBO estimates are not likely to be accurate, because they are based on the assumption that Congress is going to do everything they say they're going to do.[288] The Center on Budget and Policy Priorities objected: in its analysis, Congress has a good record of implementing Medicare savings. According to their study, Congress followed through on the implementation of the vast majority of provisions enacted in the past 20\\u00a0years to produce Medicare savings.[289][290]\\nEmployer mandate and part-time working hours\\n\\nNot to be confused with the individual mandate[291][292]\\n\\n\\nThe employer mandate is a penalty that will be incurred by employers with more than 50 employees that do not offer health insurance to their full-time workers.[293] This provision was included as a disincentive for employers considering dropping their current insurance plans once the insurance exchanges began operating as an alternative source of insurance.[294] Proponents of the reform law wanted to address the parts of the healthcare system they believed to not be working well, while causing minimal disruption to those happy with the coverage they have.[295][294] Lawmakers recognized that approximately 80% of Americans already have insurance, of whom 54% (44% of the total population) are covered directly or indirectly through an employer, and 29% (23% of the total population) are covered by the government\\u2014mainly though Medicare and Medicaid.[296][297] While 73% of the total population reported themselves satisfied with their insurance situation, significant minorities, even among those that reported favorably, had medically-related financial troubles and\\/or dissatisfaction with aspects of their insurance coverage, especially among the poor and sick.[295] The intent of the employer mandate (along with a grandfather clause in the ACA) is to help ensure that existing employer-sponsored insurance plans that people like will stay in place.[294]\\nAs no company with fewer than 50 full-time employees will face this penalty, many[who?] are concerned that the employer mandate creates a perverse incentive for business to employ people part-time instead of full-time.[298][299] This hypothetical phenomenon has sometimes been referred to by commentators on both sides of the political spectrum as \\\"The Obamacare Effect.\\\"[300][301][302]\\nDespite concerns over a massive spike in part-time workers driven by cost-cutting efforts on the part of large employers, the number of part-time jobs in the United States had, in fact, declined by 230,000, while the number of full-time jobs has increased by 2 million during the period leading up to the start-date of Obamacare as of early 2014.[302][303] Where full-time jobs have turned into part-time jobs seems to be in the public-sector, as an effort to reduce state and federal deficits, rather than as an effort to maintain or increase corporate profits in the private sectors (the original fear of individuals who coined the term 'Obamacare Effect').[302][304]\\nSeveral businesses and the State of Virginia have clarified the contracts of their part-time employees by adding a 29-hour-a-week cap,[305][unreliable source?][306][unreliable source?] to reflect the 30-hour threshold for full-time hours, as defined by the law.[293] Some labor market experts claim such shifts are not clearly attributable to the implementation of the ACA: pre-existing, long-term trends in working hours,[307] and the effects of the Great Recession correlate with part-time working hour patterns.[308][309] The impact of this provision on employers' decision-making is partially offset by other factors: offering healthcare helps attract and retain employees, while increasing productivity and reducing absenteeism; and to trade a smaller full-time workforce for a larger part-time work force carries costs of training and administration for a business.[299][307][310] The amount of employers with over 50 employees is relatively [clarification needed] small,[299] and more than 90% of these already offer insurance,[311] so changes in employer plans from this provision are expected to be small.[298] Workers who do not receive insurance from an employer plan would be able to purchase insurance on the exchanges.[312]\\nRegardless of the rationale for maintaining existing insurance arrangements for those happy with them, most policy analysts (on both the right and left) are critical of the employer mandate provision on the policy merits.[298][311] They argue that the perverse incentives regarding part-time hours, even if they do not change many existing insurance plans, are real and harmful;[313][314] that the raised marginal cost of the 50th worker for businesses could limit companies\\u2019 growth;[315] that the costs of reporting and administration\\u2014the paperwork for businesses and the state enforcement\\u2014are not worth the trade-off of incentivizing the maintenance of current employer plans;[313][314] and note that the employer mandate, unlike the individual mandate, is a non-essential part of the law.[316][292] Some analysts have suggested that an alternate 'pay or play' version of the employer mandate would partially avoid these problems, by instead taxing business that do not offer insurance by a percentage of their payroll rather than using the 50-employee and 30-hour cut-offs.[298][313][314] Furthermore, many healthcare policy analysts think it would be better to transition away from the employer-based system to systems (whether state- or market-based) where insurance is more portable and stable, and hence think that it is a bad idea to even try to maintain existing employer insurance systems.[317] The effects of the provision have also generated vocal opposition from business interests and some unions not granted exemptions.[314][318]\\nOn July 2, 2013, the Obama Administration announced on the Treasury Department's Proposed Regulations REG-138006-12[319] would delay the implementation of the employer mandate for one year, until 2015.[311][320]\\nA 2013\\/4 survey by the National Association for Business Economics found that about 75 percent of those surveyed said the ACA hasn\\u2019t influenced their planning or expectations for 2014, and 85 percent said the law wouldn\\u2019t prompt a change in their hiring practices. Some 21 percent of 64 businesses surveyed said that the act would have a harmful effect and 5 percent said it would be beneficial.[321]\\nOn 10 February 2014, the Treasury Department issued Treasury Decision 9655, which are final regulation, that it would delay the employer mandate until 2015.[319] The Treasury Decision 9655 modifies Proposed Regulations REG-138006-12.[319]\\nChanges in existing individual insurance plans\\nAt various times during and after the debate surrounding the ACA, Obama stated that \\\"if you like your health care plan, you'll be able to keep your health care plan\\\".[322][323] However, the law grandfathers only those insurance plans that were in effect before the law was enacted and have not been significantly changed since then.[323] Plans that do not satisfy these criteria must be cancelled if they do not comply with the law's new requirements for insurance standards. Furthermore, the law does not prohibit insurers from cancelling older plans for other reasons, such as a determination that a plan is too expensive to maintain. For these reasons, in fall 2013 millions of Americans with individual policies received notices that their insurance plans were being terminated,[324] and several million more are in danger of seeing their current plans cancelled.[325][326][327]\\nOn November 7, 2013, President Obama stated: \\\"I am sorry that [people losing their plans] are finding themselves in this situation based on assurances they got from me\\\", and he promised to work to help the affected Americans.[328] Various acts have been introduced in Congress to allow people to keep their existing individual insurance plans.[329] President Obama's previous unambiguous assurance that consumers' could keep their own plans has become a focal point for critics of the ACA[330][331] and a political liability for the law's proponents.[332][333] Whether or not President Obama knew that his statements were incorrect at the time he made them has also become the focus of discussion.[323][334][335]\\nClawback controversy\\nThe asset-recovery provision of Medicaid, nicknamed the \\\"clawback\\\" provision, was enacted in 1993 by Congress in response to rising Medicaid administrative costs. States were compelled to try to recover costs from the estates of the deceased who used the program for long-term care, either via liens placed on an individual's home or claims on their assets. There was also an option for states to recover other routine medical care expenses. The expansion of Medicaid under the Affordable Care Act made more residents eligible for Medicaid. The state and federal government as of February 2014 have not clarified clawback guidelines, triggering complaints from consumers and advocacy groups from the uncertainty.[336]\\nHospitals\\nFrom the start of 2010 to November 2014, 43 hospital in rural areas closed, according to the North Carolina Rural Health Research Program. Critics of the Affordable Care Act have stated that the new law has caused these hospitals to close. Many of these rural hospitals were built using funds from the 1946 Hill\\u2013Burton Act, to increase access to medical care in rural areas. Some of these hospitals have re-opened as other forms of medical facilities, but only a small number of those re-opened facilities operate emergency rooms or urgent care centers.[337]\\nPublic opinion\\nPublic opinion polls indicate that the United States public generally supports healthcare reform, but the public's views became increasingly negative in reaction to specific plans discussed during the legislative debate over 2009 and 2010. Polling statistics for the general population show a general negative opinion of the law in the first years; with those in favor at approximately 40% and those against at 51%, as of October 2013.[338][339] About 29% of whites approve of the law, compared with 61% of Hispanics and 91% of African Americans, according a Pew Research Center and USA Today survey conducted on 4\\u20138 September 2013.[340] USA Today found opinions were strongly divided by age of the person at the law's inception, with a solid majority of seniors opposing the bill and a solid majority of those younger than forty years old in favor.[341]\\nSpecific elements are very popular across the political spectrum, with the notable exception of the mandate to purchase insurance. FiveThirtyEight, describing public opinion of the law, said, \\\"while surveys have consistently found that a plurality of Americans have an overall negative view of the Affordable Care Act, they have just as consistently shown that large majorities of Americans favor individual elements of the law.\\\"[342][343] For example, a Reuters-Ipsos poll during June 2012 indicated that 44% of Americans supported the law, with 56% against. By party affiliation, 75% of Democrats, 27% of Independents, and 14% of Republicans favored the law overall. Individual provisions of the law received varying levels of support: 82% favored banning insurance companies from denying coverage to people with pre-existing conditions, 61% favored allowing children to stay on their parents' insurance until age 26, 72% supported requiring companies with more than 50 employees to provide insurance for their employees, and 39% supported the individual mandate to own insurance or pay a penalty. By party affiliation, 19% of Republicans, 27% of Independents, and 59% of Democrats favored the mandate.[344] Other polls showed additional provisions receiving majority support include the creation of insurance exchanges, pooling small businesses and the uninsured with other consumers so that more people can take advantage of large group pricing benefits, and providing subsidies to individuals and families to make health insurance more affordable.[345][346] Other specific ideas that were not enacted but which showed majority support included importing prescription drugs from Canada (with its lower, government-controlled prices),[347] limiting malpractice awards, reducing the age to qualify for Medicare, and the Public health insurance option.[348]\\nPollsters probed the reasons for opposition.[349] In a CNN poll, 62% of respondents said they thought the ACA would \\\"increase the amount of money they personally spend on health care\\\", 56% said the bill \\\"gives the government too much involvement in health care\\\", and 19% said they thought they and their families would be better off with the legislation.[350] Other polls found that people were concerned that the law would cost more than projected, and would not do enough to control the cost of health care affecting their families.[351]\\nHowever, part of the opposition to the law is because some Americans believe the reform did not go far enough: A Reuters-Ipsos poll indicated that, for those opposed to the bill, 71% of Republican opponents reject it overall while 29% believed it did not go far enough; independent opponents were divided 67% to 33%; and among the relatively much smaller group of Democratic opponents, 49% reject it overall, and 51% wanted the measure to go further.[344]\\nAs of 2011 many Democrats believed that the ACA would grow more popular over time, like Medicare did after its implementation,[352] as the benefits of the law take effect and close the information gap about the contents of the bill.[342][343][353]\\nIn June 2013, a majority of the public (52\\u201334%) indicated a desire for \\\"Congress to implement or tinker with the law rather than repeal it\\\".[354] Following the Supreme Court upholding the constitutionality of the individual mandate in National Federation of Independent Business v. Sebelius, a poll released in July 2012 showed that \\\"most Americans (56%) want to see critics of President Obama's health care law drop efforts to block it and move on to other national issues.\\\"[355] The RAND Health Reform Opinion Study for May 1, 2014, showed that 48.9% of respondents had an unfavorable view of the ACA vs. 38.3% who had a favorable view (of more than 5,500 individuals).[356]\\nPolling averages from RealClearPolitics showed public approval of the ACA as 52.1% against and 38.6% for (poll averages from February 27 to March 25, 2014).[338]\\nAn Associated Press-GfK poll released March 28, 2014 showed that 26% of Americans support the ACA.[357]\\nA Wall Street Journal\\/NBC poll released April 30, 2014, indicated that 8% of respondents say that the Affordable Care Act \\\"is working well the way it is.\\\"[358]\\nPolitical\\nTerm \\\"Obamacare\\\"\\nThe term \\\"Obamacare\\\" was originally coined by opponents of the Affordable Care Act as a pejorative term for the law. The term was first put in print in March 2007 when healthcare lobbyist Jeanne Schulte Scott penned it in a health industry journal, writing \\\"We will soon see a 'Giuliani-care' and 'Obama-care' to go along with 'McCain-care', 'Edwards-care', and a totally revamped and remodeled 'Hillary-care' from the 1990s\\\".[14][359] According to research by Elspeth Reeve at The Atlantic magazine, the expression Obamacare first was used in early 2007, generally by writers describing the candidate's proposal for expanding coverage for the uninsured.[360] The word was first uttered in a political campaign by Mitt Romney in May 2007 in Des Moines, Iowa. Romney said, \\\"In my state, I worked on healthcare for some time. We had half a million people without insurance, and I said, 'How can we get those people insured without raising taxes and without having government take over healthcare?' And let me tell you, if we don't do it, the Democrats will. If the Democrats do it, it will be socialized medicine; it'll be government-managed care. It'll be what's known as Hillarycare or Barack Obamacare, or whatever you want to call it.\\\"[14]\\nBy mid-2012, Obamacare had become the most common colloquial term used to refer to the law by both supporters and opponents. In contrast, the use of \\\"Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act\\\" or \\\"Affordable Care Act\\\" became limited to more formal and official use.[360] Use of the term in a positive sense was suggested by Democrat John Conyers.[361] President Obama endorsed the nickname, saying, \\\"I have no problem with people saying Obama cares. I do care.\\\"[362] Because of the number of \\\"Obamacare\\\" search engine queries, the Department of Health and Human Services purchased Google advertisements, triggered by the term, to direct people to the official HHS site.[363] In March 2012, the Obama reelection campaign embraced the term \\\"Obamacare\\\", urging Obama's supporters to post Twitter messages that begin, \\\"I like #Obamacare because...\\\".[364] After its debut as a phrase on Capitol Hill, according to an analysis by the Sunlight Foundation, from July 2009 to June 2012 the term \\\"Obamacare\\\" was used nearly 3,000 times in congressional speeches.[14]\\nIn October 2013 the Associated Press and NPR began cutting back on use of the term.[365] Stuart Seidel, NPR's managing editor, said that the term \\\"seems to be straddling somewhere between being a politically-charged term and an accepted part of the vernacular\\\".[366]\\nCommon misconceptions\\n\\\"Death panels\\\"\\nMain article: Death panel\\nOn August 7, 2009, Sarah Palin claimed the proposed legislation would create \\\"death panels\\\" that would decide if sick and elderly Americans were \\\"worthy\\\" of medical care.[367] The allegation was named PolitiFact's \\\"Lie of the Year\\\",[367][368] one of FactCheck's \\\"whoppers\\\",[369][370] and the most outrageous term by the American Dialect Society.[371] The AARP described such rumors as \\\"rife with gross\\u2014and even cruel\\u2014distortions.\\\"[372] In 2010, the Pew Research Center reported that 85% of Americans were familiar with the claim, and 30% believed it was true, with three contemporaneous polls finding similar results.[373] A poll in August 2012 found that 39% of Americans still believed the \\\"death panels\\\" claim.[374]\\nThe \\\"death panel\\\" misconception distorts separate issues initially related to two proposed provisions found in the early drafts of the ACA. One was a claim that under the law, seniors can be denied care due to their age[375] and the other that the government will advise them to end their own lives instead of receiving due care[376] \\u2014 the former eventually morphing into alluding to the Independent Payment Advisory Board (IPAB), which was established with the passage of the ACA, instead.[376] The IPAB has the authority to determine then recommend additional cost-saving changes to the Medicare program by facilitating the adoption of additional cost-effective treatments and similar cost-recovering measures when the statutory levels set for the administration of the Medicare program are exceeded within any given 3-year cycle scheduled. In fact, the Board is prohibited from recommending changes that would reduce payments to certain providers before 2020, and is also prohibited from recommending changes in premiums, benefits, eligibility and taxes, or other changes that would result in rationing.[377][378]\\nThe other related issue concerns advance-care planning consultation: a section of the House reform proposal would have reimbursed physicians for providing voluntary consultations of Medicare recipients on end-of-life health planning (which is also covered by many private plans), enabling patients to specify, on request, the kind of care they wish to receive in their old age.[379] As described by the site Snopes.com, \\\"This provision would allow patients to prepare for the day when they might be seriously ill and unable to make medical decisions for themselves by engaging in consultations with doctors to discuss the full range of end-of-life care options available to them, and to have the cost of such consultations covered by Medicare ... [including] directives to accept or refuse extreme life-saving measures, selection of hospice care programs, appointment of relatives\\\" to act on the patient's behalf, etc.[372] The provision was not included in the final draft of the 2009 bill that was enacted into law.[380]\\nExemptions for Congressmen\\nA separate common misconception about the ACA is that members of Congress are exempt from the Act's reforms. In fact, the ACA requires members of Congress and their staffs to obtain health insurance either through an exchange or some other program approved by the law (such as Medicare), instead of using the insurance offered to federal employees (the Federal Employees Health Benefits Program). The federal government will continue to maintain its contributions to the new health insurance plans of federal employees.[148][381][382][383][384]\\nBenefits for illegal immigrants\\nAnother common misconception is that the ACA provides benefits to illegal immigrants.[385] In fact, the ACA explicitly denies insurance subsidies to \\\"unauthorized (illegal) aliens\\\".[122][127][386]\\nOpposition and resistance\\nEfforts to oppose and repeal the legislation have drawn support from prominent conservative advocacy groups,[387][388] Congressional and many state Republicans, certain small business organizations, and the Tea Party movement.[389] These groups believe the law will lead to disruption of existing health plans, increased costs from new insurance standards, and that it will increase the deficit.[390] Some are also against the idea of universal healthcare, viewing insurance as similar to other commodities to which people are not entitled.[391][392]\\nAs of 2013[update] unions that have expressed concerns about the negative impact the ACA will have on their members' health care benefits, included the AFL-CIO,[393] which called the ACA \\\"highly disruptive\\\" to union health care plans and said it would drive up costs of union-sponsored plans; and International Brotherhood of Teamsters, United Food and Commercial Workers International Union, and UNITE-HERE, leaders of which sent a letter to Harry Reid (D-NV) and Nancy Pelosi (D-CA) stating that \\\"the ACA will shatter not only our hard-earned health benefits, but destroy the foundation of the 40 hour work week that is the backbone of the American middle class.\\\"[394] In January 2014, Terry O\\u2019Sullivan, president of the Laborers\\u2019 International Union of North America (LIUNA) and D. Taylor, president of Unite Here sent a letter to Harry Reid (D-NV) and Nancy Pelosi (D-CA) stating that, \\\"The ACA, as implemented, undermines fair marketplace competition in the health care industry.\\\"[395]\\nLegal challenges\\n\\nOpponents of the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act turned to the federal courts to challenge the constitutionality of the legislation.[396][397] In National Federation of Independent Business v. Sebelius, decided on June 28, 2012, the Supreme Court ruled on a 5\\u20134 vote that the individual mandate is constitutional under Congress's taxation powers, although the law could not have been upheld under Congress's regulatory power under the Commerce Clause. The Court also determined that states could not be forced to participate in the Medicaid expansion, effectively allowing states to opt out of this provision. As written, the ACA withheld all Medicaid funding from states declining to participate in the expansion. The Supreme Court ruled that this withdrawal of funding was unconstitutionally coercive and that individual states had the right to opt out of the Medicaid expansion without losing preexisting Medicaid funding from the federal government. All provisions of ACA will continue in effect or will take effect as scheduled subject to the states' determination on Medicaid expansion.[398]\\nIn March 2012 the Roman Catholic Church, while supportive of the ACA's objectives, has voiced concern through the United States Conference of Catholic Bishops that aspects of the mandate covering artificial contraception and sterilization and HHS's narrow definition of a religious organization were violations of the First Amendment right to free exercise of religion and conscience. Numerous lawsuits are pending addressing these concerns.[399][400]\\nState rejections of Medicaid expansion\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nMedicaid expansion by state.[401]\\n\\u00a0\\u00a0Expanding Medicaid\\n\\u00a0\\u00a0Considering Medicaid expansion\\n\\u00a0\\u00a0Not expanding Medicaid\\n\\n\\n\\nFollowing the Supreme Court ruling in NFIB v. Sebelius, several states with legislatures or governorships controlled by Republicans opted to reject the expanded Medicaid coverage provided for by the Act. Over half of the national uninsured population lives in those states.[402] As of September 2014[update], with the addition of Pennsylvania, 27 states and the District of Columbia have adopted the Medicaid expansion; a few states have remained undecided.[401][403][404] States that declined to expand Medicaid before 2014 may still choose to opt in at any time.[405]\\nThe drafters of the ACA had intended for Medicaid to cover individuals and families with incomes up to 133% (138% under effective definitions of income[40]) of the federal poverty level by expanding Medicaid eligibility and simplifying the CHIP enrollment process. Low-income individuals and families above 100% and up to 400% of the federal poverty level were to receive federal subsidies[35] on a sliding scale if they choose to purchase insurance via an exchange. For example, individuals with incomes between 133% and 150% of the poverty level would be subsidized such that their premium cost would be 3% to 4% of their income.[36] The Supreme Court ruling created the potential for a coverage gap. States that chose to reject the Medicaid expansion could maintain the pre-existing Medicaid eligibility thresholds they have set, which in many states are significantly below 133% of the poverty line for most individuals.[406] Furthermore, many states do not make Medicaid available to childless adults at any income level.[407] Because subsidies on insurance plans purchased through exchanges are not available to those below the poverty line, this created a coverage gap in those states between the state Medicaid threshold and the subsidy eligibility threshold.[408][409] For example, in Kansas, where only those able-bodied adults with children and with an income below 32% of the poverty line are eligible for Medicaid, those with incomes from 32% to 100% of the poverty level ($6,250 to $19,530 for a family of three) would be ineligible for both Medicaid and federal subsidies to buy insurance. If they have no children, able-bodied adults are not eligible for Medicaid in Kansas.[402] Studies of the impact of state decisions to reject the Medicaid expansion, as of July 2013, calculate that up to 6.4 million Americans could fall into this coverage gap.[410]\\nFor states that do expand Medicaid, the federal government pays for 100% of the expansion through 2016, and the subsidy tapers to 90% by 2020.[405] Several opposing states argue that their 10% responsibility of funding the expansion will be too much for their states' budgets.[405][411] Studies suggest that rejecting the expansion will cost states more than expanding Medicaid due to increased spending on uncompensated emergency care that otherwise would have been partially paid for by Medicaid coverage.[412]\\nNon-cooperation\\nOfficials in Texas, Florida, Alabama, Wyoming, Arizona, Oklahoma and Missouri have decided to oppose those elements of the ACA over which they have discretion.[413][414] For example, Missouri declined to expand Medicaid or establish a health insurance marketplace but is also engaged in an active program of non-cooperation, having enacted a statute forbidding any state or local official to render any aid not specifically required by federal law to the functioning of the Affordable Care Act.[415] Other Republican politicians have tried to discourage efforts to advertise the benefits of the law, and some conservative political groups have launched ad campaigns to discourage enrollment.[416][417]\\nRepeal efforts\\nThe ACA has been the subject of unsuccessful repeal efforts by Republicans in the 111th, 112th, and 113th Congresses: U.S. House Reps Steve King (R-IA) and Michele Bachmann (R-MN) introduced bills in the House to repeal the ACA the day after it was signed, as did Senator Jim DeMint (R-SC) in the U.S. Senate.[418] In 2011, after Republicans gained control of the House of Representatives, one of the first votes held was on a bill entitled \\\"Repealing the Job-Killing Health Care Law Act\\\" (H.R. 2), which the House passed on a 245\\u2013189 vote.[419] All Republicans and 3 Democrats voted for repeal.[420] House Democrats proposed an amendment that repeal not take effect until a majority of the Senators and Representatives had opted out of the Federal Employees Health Benefits Program; Republicans voted down the measure.[421] In the Senate, the bill was offered as an amendment to an unrelated bill but was voted down.[422] President Obama had stated that he would have vetoed the bill even if it had passed both chambers of Congress.[423]\\nFollowing the 2012 Supreme Court ruling upholding the ACA as constitutional, Republicans held another vote to repeal the law on July 11;[424] the House of Representatives voted with all 244 Republicans and 5 Democrats in favor of repeal, which marked the 33rd, partial or whole, repeal attempt.[425][426] With President Obama's reelection and the Democrats expanding their majority in the Senate following the 2012 elections, many Republicans conceded that repeal almost certainly will not occur.[427] On February 3, 2015 the House of Representatives added its 67th repeal vote to the record with 239 to 186 and nine members abstaining, moving the action to the Senate, where Republican Senator Ted Cruz, (R-Texas), introduced legislation for full repeal with vote on 9-2-2015.[428]\\n2013 federal government shutdown\\nStrong partisan disagreement in Congress has prevented adjustments to the Act's provisions.[429] However, at least one change, a proposed repeal of a tax on medical devices, has received bipartisan support.[430] Some Congressional Republicans argue against improvements to the law on the grounds they would weaken the arguments for repeal.[291][314]\\nRepublicans attempted to defund its implementation,[414][431] and in October 2013, House Republicans, supported by Senators Rand Paul, Ted Cruz, Mike Lee, and Marco Rubio, refused to fund the federal government unless accompanied with a delay in implementation of the ACA, after the President unilaterally pushed back the employer mandate by one year, which critics claim he had no legal right to do. The Republican-held House of Representatives passed three versions of a bill funding all elements of the government while submitting various versions which would repeal or delay the ACA, with the last version delaying enforcement of the \\u201cindividual mandate\\u201d. These bills were unable to muster enough votes in the Democrat-held Senate, with Democratic leadership stating the Senate would only pass a \\\"clean\\\" funding bill without any restrictions on the ACA. After Congress failed to pass a continuing funding resolution by midnight on October 1, a government shutdown ensued.[432][433][434] Conservative groups such as Heritage Action provided lobbying support for the linkage between the ACA and the government shutdown.[435][436][437] Senate Republicans threatened to block appointments to relevant agencies, such as the Independent Payment Advisory Board[438] and Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services.[439][440]\\nEconomic consequences\\nUntil passage of the ACA, the majority of US citizens had a company sponsored insurance plan, and the U.S. was the only rich nation where this was the case. Companies began offering insurance policies during World War II to attract talent from the reduced supply of workers, a practice later cemented by tax policies that encouraged untaxed benefits (such as health care) rather than taxable ones such as cash. Offering insurance in lieu of cash compensation made corporations responsible for their employee's health. Rising insurance costs coupled with rising salaries squeezed both benefits and salaries until aging workers found their salaries stagnating and their benefits cut.[441]\\nAs of 2014 large company policies were still the norm, since tax laws until 2018 make benefits cheaper than cash, but many employees have been losing their \\\"paternalistic\\\" corporate policies and must find their own insurance. With the insurance system introduced under the ACA, employers who stopped their company sponsored insurance plan eliminated one of their largest compensation benefits, and shifted more costs on to employees. These include insurance premiums rising to 28% in 2013, compared with 26% in 2003, according to the Kaiser Family Foundation, and more workers paying deductibles of $1,000 reaching 38% in 2013, more than twice what it was in 2008. According to one study, as of 2014, only 25% of firms saw themselves offering any insurance in 10 years.[441]\\nTo avoid the ACA requirements[442] for firms over 50 people, smaller firms have been reducing their workforces to part-time workers, usually one hour below the federal requirement for full-time work.[citation needed] This will improve hiring and salary while simultaneously improve the efficiency of healthcare policies and worker mobility.[citation needed]\\nThe House Republican leadership put forth the argument in favor of repeal that \\\"this is a job-killing law, period.\\\"[443] They contended that the ACA would lead to a loss of 650,000 jobs, attributing the figure to a report by the Congressional Budget Office.[443] However, FactCheck noted that the 650,000 figure was not included in the CBO report referred to, saying that the Republican statement \\\"badly misrepresents what the Congressional Budget Office has said about the law. In fact, CBO is among those saying the effect [on employment] 'will probably be small.'\\\"[443] PolitiFact rated the Republican statement as false.[444]\\nJonathan Cohn, citing the projections of the CBO, summarized that the primary employment effect of the ACA is to alleviate job lock: \\\"People who are only working because they desperately need employer-sponsored health insurance will no longer do so.\\\"[445] He concluded that the \\\"reform's only significant employment impact was a reduction in the labor force, primarily because people holding onto jobs just to keep insurance could finally retire\\\" because they have health insurance outside of their jobs.[446]\\nImpact of repeal on federal budget projections\\nIn May 2011, the nonpartisan Congressional Budget Office (CBO) analyzed proposals to repeal the law. Mirroring its analysis of the law itself, the CBO estimated that repealing the entire law (both its taxing and spending provisions) would increase the net 2011\\u20132021 federal deficit by $210 billion.[447][448] Revised CBO accounting, following the July 11, 2012, House repeal vote (H.R. 6079), and taking into account the impact of Supreme Court ruling, was consistent with its previous estimate: that repeal would cause a net increase in federal budget deficits of $109 billion over the 2013\\u20132022 period.[449]\\nSee also\\n\\n\\nReferences\\n\\n\\n^ Pear, Robert (July 7, 2012). \\\"Health Law Critics Prepare to Battle Over Insurance Exchange Subsidies\\\".

Humphries II claimed under oath that he \\\"was told by supervisors that\\\" the 2012 presidential election \\\"would explain the potential reason why there was so much interference\\\" in the case \\\"from headquarters, that nobody wanted this case during an election cycle.\\\"The deposition is part of the lawsuit brought by Dr. Scott and Jill Kelley against government agencies, departments and major figures in the Obama administration for allegedly defaming their character in the Petraeus-Broadwell sex scandal. The affair between Petraeus and Broadwell, his biographer-turned mistress, brought a disgraced end to the decorated general's career.Though the Kelleys were the victims of the original cyberstalking case, as the Petraeus scandal exploded in the public, Jill Kelley's name was dragged through the mud by unnamed Obama administration and law enforcement officials and many in the media painted her in a particularly unflattering light, the subject of the Kelley's lawsuit.Petraeus pleaded guilty last month to one federal charge of removing and retaining classified information, having improperly shared his black books with Broadwell and lied about it to the FBI. He is scheduled to be sentenced on Thursday. READ: Petraeus says ISIS isn't the biggest long-term threat facing U.S.All charges against Broadwell were dropped in December 2012.Humphries testified he believed Kelley's name had been leaked by someone at FBI headquarters \\\"and it seemed to be a purposeful attempt to discredit both Mrs. Kelley and myself.\\\"Humphries said in his deposition he was confused by FBI's leaders' focus on Jill Kelley instead of Broadwell, whom they identified as the cyberstalker as early as June 2012. He testified her actions compromised security of high-level military intelligence personnel and information, but for some reason higher-ups in the FBI kept interfering in what seemed to him to be a fairly straightforward case. In one incident, FBI agents were called back from the airport as they were about to fly to North Carolina to interview Broadwell.All the while, the FBI kept shifting focus on the victims in the case, Humphries testified, or more specifically on Jill Kelley. He testified he would occasionally hear \\\"lewd comments\\\" from FBI agents about Kelley, including one individual making \\\"a comment that he was pleased that Mrs. Kelley was in the Citizens' Academy and that [he] had nominated her because of her [big] breasts.\\\"\\\"I couldn't understand why there was so much animosity\\\" against Jill Kelley amongst his FBI superiors, Humphries testified. \\\"[I]t was stated in some ways and reflected in the body language that their view was that Jill Kelley had sort of brought this on herself and was some femme fatale,\\\" he said. He wondered if this warped view of the case was rooted in \\\"ineptness, incompetence or was politically motivated,\\\" he testified.A  request for comment made by CNN to a representative of Paula Broadwell was not met by press time.Alan Raul, an attorney for the Kelleys, also declined comment to CNN on Sunday, as did Petraeus attorney Robert Barnett. A spokesman for the Justice Department did not return a call from CNN on Sunday; a spokesman for the FBI did not offer any comment. The administration has refrained from commenting on the case in the past given the current litigation.Other law enforcement officials told CNN what Humphries and others regarded as interference from headquarters could also be seen as efforts to ensure the FBI did everything by the book in a highly sensitive case. (They got court-approved warrants for things normally the FBI can administratively subpoena). Some at the FBI thought Humphries did things to keep inserting himself into the case even after he was told to recuse himself given that he had a friendly relationship with Kelley. Those efforts allegedly include attempts at communication that Humphries is sais to have had during the course of the investigations with then-House Majority Leader Eric Cantor, R-Virginia.He testified that he and his wife and children are friends with the Kelleys and their children through their outreach to the military and law enforcement communities in Tampa, and did not understand his bosses' insinuations or harsh judgments.Were some officials in the Obama administration attempting misdirection away from the CIA Director in the thick of the 2012 presidential race? Were they motivated by sexism or some other pre-judgment of Kelley? These are implicit and explicit suggestions in the lawsuit, respectively, but as of now there has not been any clear answer from the administration as to why -- according to the Kelleys' suit and Humphries' deposition -- law enforcement officials were so skeptical of Jill Kelley.FBI blaming the victims?The story began in May 2012, when four-star Gen. John Allen began receiving e-mails from \\\"kelleypatrol@gmail.com,\\\" which \\\"disparaged\\\" Kelley and referenced an upcoming private dinner the Kelleys were hosting with \\\"several senior foreign intelligence, defense and diplomatic officials,\\\" according to the lawsuit. The email troubled Allen given the potential security concern and \\\"frightened the Kelleys, as it indicated that Mrs. Kelley was being followed or stalked, and raised serious concerns about her own safety and well being, particularly given the number of terrorist risks faced by CENTCOM leaders.\\\"SEE: Petraeus pleads guilty to federal chargeBroadwell later admitted to having sent that email as well as another from \\\"Tampa Angel\\\" to Dr. Scott Kelley, also disparaging his wife, promising \\\"embarrassment for all, including spouses, such as info in national headlines.\\\"Jill Kelley reached out to Humphries, an FBI Agent whom she and her husband knew socially. \\\"She explained that Gen. Allen had received an odd e-mail,\\\" Humphries testified, noting that \\\"whoever sent these e-mails is either in close physical proximity or has penetrated the cyber security of these folks to include the director of the Central Intelligence Agency, Director Petraeus, and I was worried and concerned for his safety, the safety of the generals.\\\"Humphries thought the emails \\\"ominous\\\" and contacted Special Agent Adam Malone of the Tampa Cyber Squad. \\\"We had already reached the threshold on the cyber or physical security of senior government leadership and possible their email,\\\" he said.By the third week of June, the FBI had identified Broadwell as the cyberstalker, Humphries said, relating how he saw FBI videotape of \\\"a BMW pulling up to a Starbucks in North Carolina and shortly thereafter the alleged subject of the case enters and logs on, and some of the e-mails were being sent, so they had a firm idea of who it was.\\\"In an attempt to apparently suss out whatever rivalry or animus might exist between Broadwell and Kelley, Humphries was asked to call Kelley, \\\"sort of like a ruse like to see if Mrs. Kelley knew who the subject was.\\\" He did so, and asked her for a book recommendation for background on Petraeus. But Kelley didn't mention Broadwell or her book about the man with whom she'd had an affair, \\\"All In: The Education of David Petraeus.\\\"According to Humphries, when he raised the title of the book, Kelley said, \\\"Gen. Petraeus doesn't really like that book. He said the person who came and wrote it sort of came in for the guise of being an academic researcher and then ended up writing a book.\\\"Humphries said he was surprised Kelley didn't know the name of the book let alone the author. If Broadwell \\\"would have some animus against Mrs. Kelley, Mrs. Kelley doesn't even know who she is,\\\" he recalled thinking.Meanwhile, others in the FBI were heading in an altogether different direction with their judgments of the jet-setting socialites, Humphries said. \\\"I was surprised throughout the process of the marginalization of Mrs. Kelley as a victim in this case because I heard comments from them saying things like -- you know, I reminded them at one point, you may not agree with the lifestyle of the Kelleys, but they're victims in this crime,\\\" he testified.The special agent in charge, Steven Ibison, \\\"kind of rolled his eyes and snorted at the proposal that I said they were victims,\\\" Humphries said.\\\"The only victim is her husband because he has to pay for all the food that she goes out and eats and takes pictures of and sends to everyone,\\\" said Kevin Eaton, the assistant special agent in charge, according to Humphries. Kelley is often took photos of her food when she goes out to eat and sends them to her friends, a source close to Kelley said.It was a comment that \\\"shocked and surprised\\\" Humphries since it revealed that the FBI was looking at Kelley's e-mails beyond the ones relevant to the cyberstalking, contrary to Kelley's explicit instruction.\\\"Something was starting to shift in my mind to make me realize that they had a different view of this than how I understand what was taking place,\\\" he testified.This was all \\\"Completely counter to the Jill Kelley that I had known for three years and her husband, Scott Kelley. And I couldn't understand why there was so much angst over this very simple criminal case that could be resolved very quickly and expeditiously and yet was being made far more complicated,\\\" he said.But soon the FBI leaders would be challenging Humphries' integrity and marital fidelity as well.The FBI director \\\"just shoved these up my ass\\\"It's not surprising that a case involving cyberstalking of top generals and the CIA director would prompt the awareness of higher-ups at the FBI. But the behavior from those officials in Washington, shocked Humphries.In June 2012, Humphries was told by Stacy Arruda, FBI supervisory special agent with the Tampa Division of the Cyber Crime, FBI agents went to the airport to fly to North Carolina to interview Broadwell. \\\"But they were called back to have their questions reviewed,\\\" by Ibison, the special agent in charge, Humphries said. He said his understand was that deputy director of the FBI Joyce \\\"halted\\\" the interview of Broadwell, which was not consistent with FBI protocol.Arruda became so \\\"concerned and was frustrated by the high level of direction,\\\" Humphries said, she ultimately \\\"felt it was wise to keep a separate copy\\\" of all the evidence in the case. Ultimately Arruda told Humphries that higher-ups essentially removed her from the case.In July 2012, Joyce summoned Ibison out of meeting, Humphries testified. Humphries testified that he was later told that he was the subject of the discussion; Eaton, the assistant special agent in charge, told Humphries that Joyce and the director of the FBI Robert Mueller suggested that Humphries was having an inappropriate relationship with Jill Kelley.Humphries said he was \\\"completely blind-sided by that accusation and actually shocked and stunned ... I immediately denied it and offered to voluntarily take a polygraph at the same time.\\\" He said he was confused as to why the FBI focused on Kelley and him instead of Broadwell.In September 2012 Ibison \\\"summoned\\\" Humphries to a meeting and asked him \\\"whether there was anything in my communications with Jill Kelley for which I would be embarrassed,\\\" he testified.\\\"No,\\\" Humphries said, and Ibison \\\"threw a bunch of pictures at me and files of my e-mails to Jill Kelley.\\\"\\\"Well, I told the director that and he just shoved these up my ass,\\\" Ibison said, according to Humphries, \\\"and he tossed the pictures at me.\\\"The photographs to Humphries were completely innocent, including \\\"Halloween photos, photos at hookah bars with other employees ... One was a picture of the famous mannequin picture with me shirtless between the two, pictures that I had sent to all my supervisors and they had used at annual conferences as funny pictured from the division.\\\"The origin of the \\\"mannequin\\\" picture -- described in the media when the story broke in November 2012 as a \\\"shirtless photo\\\" the FBI agent sent to Jill Kelley -- was hardly seductive, as Humphries describes it.At a range in 2009, members of the SWAT team \\\"were joking that my bald head looked like the shirtless dummies that we had. And so somebody suggested that we take a picture ... And we took picture and it went out to 50 different people,\\\" Humphries said. \\\"I actually sent it to Scott Kelley's email address ... it was never meant to be anything but a joke.\\\"\\\"These are pictures you saw before,\\\" Humphries said, according to the deposition. Ibison's response was, \\\"Well, it was OK inside the FBI but not OK to share it outside the FBI,\\\" according to Humphries.Humphries left his meeting with Ibison under the impression that FBI Director Mueller believed \\\"that I had messed up the case for the government because of my ... alleged inappropriate misconduct with Mrs. Kelley, that I had ruined the government's case to ever be able to fully prosecute without embarrassing the bureau.\\\"Meanwhile, at this point Petraeus had not been interviewed.When Humphries asked his supervisor about the direction of the case, he was told, \\\"No one wants to be involved in a case like this during an election cycle.\\\"Election Day was Nov. 6, 2012. Three days later, Petraeus resigned, after which senior military and law enforcement officials leaked Kelley's name to the media. Accusations soon followed, with ABC News reporting that the FBI had \\\"uncovered 'potentially inappropriate' emails between Gen. Allen and Kelley\\\" and Fox News saying the officials \\\"characterize certain email communications as the \\\"'equivalent of phone sex over email,'\\\" charges the Kelleys vociferously deny.Jill Kelley's lawsuit states that her \\\"reputation is indelibly tainted ... consistently referred to as the 'center' of the 'sex scandal' and is often portrayed as the woman who brought down two American generals.\\\"In addition, amidst the wild media fracas of this case, Gen. Allen's anticipated promotion to Supreme Allied Commander of Europe for NATO was delayed until an investigation into his relationship with Kelley was completed. By the time he was cleared of all wrongdoing, Allen had retired from the military. Humphries has a long and decorated career with the FBI, working on the Joint Terrorism Task Forces in Seattle and Tampa, as well as serving as program manager for FBI operations at Bagram Air Force Base in Afghanistan. In 2002 he received the director's award for outstanding counterterrorism investigation for his work helping the thwart the would be Millennium bomber Ahmed Ressam; in 2012 he received the FBI Medal of Valor for a 2010 incident where he shot and killed a man wielding a knife outside MacDill Air Force Base. Among the many others whom will likely be deposed in the case are former FBI Deputy Director Sean Joyce, former Secretary of Defense Leon Panetta, and Secretary of the Department of Homeland Security Jeh Johnson, who at the time was general counsel at the Pentagon.CNN's Evan Perez contributed to this report.\",\n                \"source\": \"www.cnn.com\",\n                \"publishDate\": \"2015-04-20T04:20:49+02:00\",\n                \"sourceType\": \"web\",\n                \"language\": \"en\",\n                \"googleRank\": 9,\n                \"relatedDocs\": [\n\n                ]\n            },\n            {\n                \"id\": 186676322,\n                \"url\": \"http:\\/\\/robinwestenra.blogspot.com\\/2015\\/04\\/the-chinese-response-to-nz-spying.html\",\n                \"title\": \"\\n\\n\\nChina\\nconcerned at reports of New Zealand-U.S. plan to spy on diplomats\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n19\\nApril, 2014\\n\\n\\n\\nWELLINGTON,\\nApril 19 (Xinhua) -- China on Sunday expressed concern about a report\\nthat New Zealand \",\n                \"content\": \"\\n\\n\\nChina\\nconcerned at reports of New Zealand-U.S. plan to spy on diplomats\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n19\\nApril, 2014\\n\\n\\n\\nWELLINGTON,\\nApril 19 (Xinhua) -- China on Sunday expressed concern about a report\\nthat New Zealand and United States spy agencies planned to hack into\\na data link between Chinese government buildings in Auckland.\\n\\n\\n\\nThe\\nplan was revealed in documents from U.S. National Security Agency\\n(NSA) whistleblower Edward Snowden, the Herald on Sunday newspaper\\nreported.\\n\\n\\n\\nThe\\nproject run by New Zealand's Government Communications Security\\nBureau (GCSB) and the NSA appeared aimed at tapping data flowing\\nbetween the Chinese Consulate and its visa office in Auckland.\\n\\n\\n\\nThe\\ndocuments said the GCSB had identified the data link, and agreed to\\ncooperate with the NSA to use the link to access China's computer\\nsystems, said the report.\\n\\n\\n\\nDocuments\\nappeared to show the plan was codenamed \\\"Frostbite\\\" by the\\nGCSB and \\\"Basilhayden\\\" -- also identified as fictional spy\\nJames Bond's drink of choice -- by the NSA.\\n\\n\\n\\nThe\\npaperwork revealed the GCSB worked with the NSA's elite hacker team\\n-- the Tailored Access Operations division -- which specialized in\\ncracking computer systems and planting spyware on computers, said the\\nreport.\\n\\n\\n\\nA\\n2013 NSA document showed China at the top of a list of targets it was\\nhaving monitored by the GCSB, saying the New Zealand agency gave the\\nNSA \\\"access to areas and countries that are difficult for the\\nUnited States to access.\\\"\\n\\n\\n\\nBut\\nit is unknown if the plan went ahead because, as sign-off was being\\nsought, Snowden walked out of his job with a mass of top secret\\ndocuments.\\n\\n\\n\\nThe\\nChinese Embassy in New Zealand issued a statement Sunday, saying that\\nChina was concerned about the report and attached great importance to\\nthe cyber security issue.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\\"We\\nwill firmly safeguard our security interests and continue to\\nguarantee our cyber and information security with concrete measures,\\\"\\nsaid the statement.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\\"At\\npresent, cyber space is riddled with chaos and uncertainty.

\"content\": \"James Risen, Pay Any Price: Greed, Power and Endless War (New York: Houghton Mifflin Harcourt, 2014).Following the events in Paris at Hebdo Charlie and the accompanying media frenzy concerning freedom of expression and freedom of the press, James Risen\\u2019s recent book Pay Any Price becomes, ironically, even more important than its original intention of uncovering the abuses of governmental power that tend to be hidden from view of the mainstream media.Much of what Risen writes about are the efforts of the government and its various agencies and cohorts trying to maintain secrecy around its efforts to keep the endless war going in order to keep the profits rolling in.Following on a previous expose on the CIA \\u00a0that highlighted the secrecy and manipulations of the CIA within the Bush \\u201cwar on terror\\u201d (State of War, Free Press, 2006), Pay Any Price highlights how the Obama administration is a continuation of the Bush administration. \\u201cObama\\u2019s great achievement\\u2014or great sin\\u2014was to make the national security state permanent\\u201d, he writes.Further, \\u201cAmerica has become accustomed to a permanent state of war\\u2026.the creation of a homeland security complex at a time of endless war has bequeathed us with the central narrative of the war on terror\\u2014modern tales of greed joined hand in hand with stories of abuse of power.\\u201dEach chapter focuses on one or two particular story lines to highlight the activities of these deeper government activities and their efforts to keep them quiet.\\u00a0 Quirky characters who managed to ingratiate themselves with the powerful in Washington are presented alongside those who have stood against the tide of corruption, secrecy, greed and power.Business, money and powerThe first chapter, \\u201cPallets of Cash\\u201d explores the billions of dollars in cash that were distributed in Iraq during the 2003 war, much of which went missing, unaccounted for, while a couple billion more are reportedly stored in a Lebanon \\u2018safe site\\u2019.\\u00a0 One of Risen\\u2019s current problems stems from the nature of his sources, many of whom he does not identify\\u2014for obvious reasons\\u2014but who are of interest to the powers that be in order to squelch them.\\u00a0 As for the billions of dollars of missing cash, one has to wonder how much of that has gone to fund the strange rise of ISIS, its well-armed devotees, and its well-trained units.In \\u201cThe Emperor of the War on Terror\\u201d, the story of Dennis Montgomery\\u2019s scam of the CIA creating \\u201cone of the most elaborate and dangerous hoaxes in American history\\u201d is outlined.\\u00a0 The CIA \\u201cburied the episode and acted like it never happened\\u2026trying to block any information about Montgomery and his schemes from becoming public.\\u201d\\u00a0\\u00a0 More wonder, as this puts into question all the \\u2018saves\\u2019 claimed by the government against supposed terrorist actions.As with all wars, money is to be made. \\u201cThe New Oligarchs\\u201d looks at the companies and personnel involved with the drone wars (General Atomics), Abu Ghraib (CACI), and the training of Afghan police (Dyncorp).\\u00a0 Power is the accompaniment to money.\\u00a0 In \\u201cRosetta\\u201d, Risen outlines the convoluted history of the 9\\/11 lawsuit against the Saudi financial elites.\\u00a0 It is an awkward story to follow as shady characters acting within the shadows of government (including some within government) work towards their own ends, not necessarily those of the plaintiffs.Risen writes, \\u201cThe web of relationships that developed among Motley Rice, Mike Asimos, Rosetta, the Pentagon, the FBI, and the DEA operated completely outside the government\\u2019s normal intelligence-gathering processes \\u2026 so dependent on personal contacts that few people in the government ever had the nerve to go back and try to unravel exactly what happened.\\u201dThe story of Rosetta shows how Bush \\u201creached for a national security answer to terrorism rather than a law enforcement solution \\u2026 using the courts was never an option.\\u201d\\u00a0 It also shows how \\u201cgreed and ambition have been married to unlimited rivers of cash\\u201d to create \\u201crogue intelligence operations with little or no adult supervision.\\u201dThese currents of cash, power and ambition continue in the next chapter, \\u201cAlarbus\\u201d, a tale of \\u201ca runaway covert action program\\u201d underscoring \\u201chow greed and the hunt for cash have all too often become the main objects of\\u00a0 the war on terror.\\u201dNot to be outdone for cash and power, \\u201cToo Big To Fail\\u201d looks at KBR, the spin off from Dick Cheney\\u2019s Halliburton, the former \\u201cconnected to the \\u2018vast majority\\u2019 of war-zone fraud cases referred to investigators.\\u201d\\u00a0\\u00a0 KBR became the \\u201cbiggest money machine of the Iraq war\\u201d, with a \\u201ccontracting bonanza on an unprecedented scale,\\u201d and a \\u201cvirtual monopoly over basic services,\\u201d giving KBR \\u201cenormous influence and inevitably helped shape the course of the war.\\u201dHumanityPart III, \\u201cEndless War,\\u201d has three chapters titled \\u201cThe War on\\u2026 Decency\\/Normalcy\\/Truth.\\u201d\\u00a0\\u00a0 The overriding theme concerns the lack of respect in general for humanity and what should be humanitarian principles of interaction domestically and with foreign affairs.\\u00a0 It is the story of torture, domestic security in the physical sense, and finally the efforts of the NSA to establish itself as the hub of cyberspace security around the world.The first idea, decency, examines the excuses and abuses for the application of torture, an idea that has surfaced before[1] and more recently with the Senate report condemning the CIA\\u2019s use of enhanced interrogation.\\u00a0 Risen\\u2019s story follows that of Damien Corsetti, who described Abu Ghraib by saying, \\u201cif an evil place ever existed, that was it.\\u00a0 It was all just death and fucking death.\\u00a0 That single place changed everyone who was there.\\u00a0 A cancerous growth went on there.\\u201d\\u00a0 As should be common knowledge, \\u201cThe only people who have been held to account are those who were at the very bottom of the chain of command.\\u201dThe whole torture archipelago, which extended well beyond Abu Ghraib and the CIA, \\u201cwas built on a myth \\u2026 despite strong evidence to the contrary.\\u201d The newly redefined torture tactics\\u2014\\u201cenhanced interrogation techniques\\u201d\\u2014\\u201chad been originally designed to break men

In the upside down world of the global war on terror, their explanations were widely accepted.\\u201dAfter reading this chapter, another wonder rises:\\u00a0 why would anyone bother to visit a psychiatrist or psychologist, as they and their associations were complicit in the torture setup.\\u201cThe War on Normalcy\\u201d first explores the towns of Derbyline, VT, and Stanstead, Quebec, really just one village bisected by the international border and, before 9\\/11, without any concerns about citizens meandering back and forth going about their daily business.\\u00a0 That of course changed post 9\\/11, as one resident said, \\u201cThere\\u2019s no negotiating with these people [Homeland Security].\\u00a0 It\\u2019s totally senseless.\\u00a0 There is no thought put into it.\\u00a0 Al Qaeda has won.\\u00a0 They have changed our lives.\\u201d\\u00a0 Big business, big money, has also won.To this day, \\u201cThe rush to transform the United States from an open society to a walled fortress \\u2026 has not been curbed by the killing of Osama bin Laden.\\u201d\\u00a0 The U.S., and indeed much of the western world, has succumbed to the fear of terror, \\u201creinforced by the network of independent terrorism analysts that has grown up around the global war on terror \\u2026 by consistently warning that America is under siege [they] have built a cottage industry out of fear.\\u201dTerror is used as a political strength.\\u00a0 \\u201cIn the White House and Congress \\u2026 American leaders have learned that keeping the terrorist threat alive provides enormous political benefits.\\u201d\\u00a0 It is also used to create wealth for those in power and connected to power, \\u201cFear sustains the multibillion dollar security industry through both Republican and Democratic administrations.\\u201dThis fear factor carries over into the final chapter, \\u201cThe War on Truth,\\u201d which discusses the burgeoning role of the NSA and cyber security.\\u00a0 It is \\u201cthe story of the people who tried to stop the NSA\\u2019s domestic spying program \\u2026 in the face of money, power, and greed.\\u00a0\\u00a0 It is also the story of how government secrecy\\u2014and a crackdown on whistleblowers\\u2014has enabled the worst excesses of the post 9\\/11 era to go unchecked, from torture to data mining on a massive scale.\\u00a0 Secrecy has enabled a new class of national security entrepreneurs and wild freebooters.\\u00a0 Secrecy breeds corruption.\\u201dSecrecy, greed, and corruption go together, \\u201cgovernment secrecy has prevented the public from understanding the true nature of the cyber threat or knowing the full extent of the government\\u2019s intrusions into their online privacy in the name of cybersecurity.\\u201d\\u00a0\\u00a0 There is, as per Edward Snowden, \\u201clittle real difference between cybersecurity and domestic surveillance.\\u201dThere is now a whole new cybersecurity industrial complex, one which is also used offensively, as \\u201cthe NSA is now one of the world\\u2019s leaders in the use of offensive cyberattacks,\\u201d and \\u201chas been behind some of the most sophisticated and damaging cyberattacks ever mounted,\\u201d\\u2014except of course for those we do not hear about, either from the U.S.\\/Israel side, or the \\u2018other\\u2014evil\\u2019 side.In closing, Risen says that his response to both the government\\u2019s campaign against him and to the endless wars and endless fear factors is the writing of Pay Any Price.\\u00a0 It is his answer as \\u201cto how best challenge the government\\u2019s draconian efforts to crack down on aggressive investigative journalism and suppress the truth in the name of ceaseless war.\\u201dRisen\\u2019s writing is clear and concise.\\u00a0 He notes when certain personnel have refused comment on a particular subject, and has kept some of his sources at their request, from being named.\\u00a0 The information he provides is well referenced and he uses outside indicators to support his anecdotal material.\\u00a0\\u00a0 It is an enlightening read for the individual stories that are told, and for the repercussions that the global war on terror, and its associated\\u00a0 power, greed, and secrecy has had on our daily lives.Note[1] Two books well worth reading concerning torture, its history, applications and illegalities:Philippe Sands, Torture Team: Deception, Cruelty and the Compromise of Law (New York: Allen Lane, 2008).Alfred W.

In 2014, it enjoyed the biggest IPO in Israeli history, raising about $1B at a market capitalization of $5.3B (last time I checked, the market cap was close 10B). That might modest here, in Silicon Valley. But in Israel, the impact is huge. And not just in terms in dollars. They are an inspiration to many start-ups in Start-up Nation who until last year could only imagine smaller exits. But it\\u2019s also about the tech: Mobileye has developed a unique set of technologies that assist drivers by warning them of potential collisions and recommending moves to mitigate risk. \\nThe key word is assist. When I met with leaders of the company \\u2013 as part of a recent delegation to Israel \\u2013 their elevator pitch was not only crisp but nicely focused on the idea that the company was in the business of building \\u201cdriver assistance systems.\\u201d Working with car manufacturers, they are also part of a future market whose narrative has been hijacked by visions of driverless cars. But the way Mobileye has been telling its story, the narrative has a more human element. We may look to the future not just as a place where technology does the driving for us, but where technology may in fact make us better drivers. \\nAdding a human element to the narrative about the future of driving is a good thing. The narrative today is creepy, and may not be effective with consumers (it robs people of their sense of agency; machines, not humans, will be in control). The new narrative could also be good for expanding the market for the future of driving. At a time when a broad set of technologies are accelerating so quickly that we fear them, we can be thinking about markets that will grow by putting these technologies to empower people, not disenfranchise them. \\nIn other words, there may soon be a bigger market for \\u201cassistive technologies.\\u201d And in Israel, we\\u2019re beginning to see what might very well become a new market for assistive vision technologies. Directly after we spoke with the Mobileye execs, we met with one of the founders of Orcam, a company that has developed a wearable device \\u201cdesigned to assist people who are visually impaired\\u201d (emphasis added). Amnon Shashua, co-founder of Mobileye is also a co-founder of Orcam. And while the technologies and use cases are different, the orientation toward human experience is consistent. \\nThey might also inspire more innovation of this kind. Just as Israel has developed ecosystems for tech categories like cyber security (the subject of an article I posted several weeks ago) and agriculture, the subject of an article I plan to post later), Israel might develop a rich ecosystem for a broader range of assistive technologies and medical devices. I got peek into that world during my visit to the MEDinISRAEL\\u00a0conference. But after I returned to the states, I heard directly from a company called RayGo that\\u2019s running a thus-far successful Indiegogo campaign to deliver a device you clamp onto your steering wheel that enables you to more safely respond to incoming messages on your mobile apps. The company, which developed \\u201ceye-free patented technology created for the blind,\\u201d sees an opportunity to assist consumers with the future of driving, Mobileye\\u2019s market. \\nWill we see more tech like this coming out of Israel? If yes, it could be good for entrepreneurs, good for the nation \\u2013 it is still growing, and it can and should be known for more than its prowess in cyber security \\u2013 and good for all of us. The narrative should not be \\u201cman versus machine,\\u201d but rather \\u201cmachine at the service of man.\\u201d \\u00a0That\\u2019s could be the meta-narrative for all future technology development. \\u00a0Let\\u2019s see how well Israeli entrepreneurs can get behind it. \\n\\n \\n Source: Mobileye video\\n \\n\\u00a0 \\n\\u00a0 \\n\\u00a0 \\n\\u00a0\\n\\n\\n\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\n\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\",\n                \"source\": \"www.forbes.com\",\n                \"publishDate\": \"2015-04-19T22:34:00+02:00\",\n                \"sourceType\": \"web\",\n                \"language\": \"en\",\n                \"googleRank\": 8,\n                \"relatedDocs\": [\n\n                ]\n            },\n            {\n                \"id\": 186612151,\n                \"url\": \"http:\\/\\/palashbiswaslive.blogspot.com\\/2015\\/04\\/the-khazarian-mafia-plotting-another-911.html\",\n                \"title\": \"After the 9\\/11 attack, Benjamin Netanyahu was elated.

Eschelbeck gave his two cents on the issue of user privacy being compromised at times as a result of companies like Google ramping up their security.&#13;\\nEschelbeck says otherwise, noting that \\\"security and privacy\\\" go hand in hand instead of in opposing streams. He describes privacy in the same light as security, deeming it as a user\\u2019s right to protect his or her personal information from being displayed on the internet without consent. Eschelbeck adds that Google has been making increased efforts to \\\"double down\\\" on privacy. He aims to bring in increased security to the internet telling AFP, \\\"I hope for a time when all the traffic on the Internet is encrypted.\\\" Eschelbeck is certain that by 2018 users will be subject to a great number of checks aside from the typical password.&#13;\\nLast year Google was scrutinized by for breaching people\\u2019s privacy. The company was accused of wrongfully putting up certain bits of information that a user prefers to keep private. Accordingly a Spanish citizen filled a case against Google wherein he demanded that the company take down a photo of his repossessed home from its search results. EU\\u2019s Court of Justice subsequently ordered Google to delist or take down links to old \\u2018irrelevant \\u2018information on special request. Google meanwhile expressed disappointment over this arguing that this act was sheer censorship.&#13;\\nGerhard Eschelbeck joined Google as its security chief earlier this year. During his interview he expressed great excitement over the prospect of managing online security on such a large scale. Considering that the search engine giant has a plethora of products, it could face cyber attacks on several fronts. This however also means that Google\\u2019s security experts use advanced technological equipment to tackle these attacks.&#13;\\nEschelbeck has been involved with cyber security for almost 20 years, with the majority of that time being spent at computer security pioneer McAfee. He has also worked with a variety of tech companies as a consultant owns a lot of network security patents.

This exam, globally launched at the Cyber Security Week in The Hague in The Netherlands, builds on the recently launched EXIN Secure Programming certification.Estimates of current annual cost to the global economy from cybercrime range between $375 and $575 billion, according to a recent study published by McAfee.* The worldwide cyber security market on the other hand is an emerging market and expected to grow from $71 billion in 2014 to $155+ billion by 2019, according to the latest forecast from Gartner, Inc.\\nAs worldwide cyber security threats and the global cyber security services market are on the rise, EXIN experiences a growing demand for certifications in the field of cyber security related subjects. Anticipating this trend EXIN recently launched its Security Framework \\u2013 a certification cluster with an expanding portfolio of cyber security exams such as Ethical hacking.\\nThe global availability of the EXIN Ethical Hacking Foundation certification means IT professionals are provided with a vendor-neutral Ethical Hacking competence confirmation, from an internationally acknowledged certification institute. The new exam tests IT professionals on basic knowledge and understanding of \\u201cEthical Hacking\\u201d \\u2013 the ability to evaluate IT security systems by exploiting hardware and software vulnerabilities using hacking techniques. Ethical hacking is a well-known method of duplicating the intent and actions of malicious hackers, also known as black hats, used by security professionals, the white hats, to locate and evaluate infrastructural weaknesses.\\nThe EXIN Ethical Hacking Foundation certification covers a variety of hacking related subjects and techniques, including network traffic analyzing, wireless network hacking, network scanning and the penetration of computer systems and websites.\\nMore in detail, candidates are tested on their knowledge and understanding with regards to (but not limited to) the following topics:\\n\\u2022 Network sniffing (gathering information from network traffic)\\n\\u2022 Cracking a WPA(2) key from a wireless network\\n\\u2022 An introduction to worms and botnets\\n\\u2022 Network vulnerability scanning\\n\\u2022 Basic penetration of computer systems\\n\\u2022 Password cracking\\n\\u2022 Web-based hacking, containing SQL Injections (SQLi), Cross-Site Scripting (XSS), Remote File Inclusions (RFI)\\n\\u2022 Analyzing log files\\n\\u201cEthical Hacking Foundation is another proof of EXIN\\u2019s ability to deliver the right IT certifications at the right time,\\u201d said Bernd Taselaar, CEO of EXIN. \\u201cCyber-Security will remain a hot topic in 2015 and beyond. We already had the management focused Information Security based on ISO\\/IEC 27002 certification. Next to that, the expanding Security Framework now caters to the growing security certification needs of IT professionals like programmers and developers. EXIN sees a strong market demand for high-quality IT security certifications. The e-CF principles incorporated in EXIN\\u2019s exams ensure that the certifications live up to market expectations.\\u201d\\nRecently launched within the Security Framework is EXIN Secure Programming Foundation, a certification for software developers and programmers who want to have their skills in Building Security In validated. EXIN Ethical Hacking Foundation builds on the Secure Programming certification, by adding risk assessment within application and web development to EXIN\\u2019s certification portfolio.The new certification, based on the e-Competence Framework (e-CF)** will initially be made available in English, with language localizations in a variety of global markets following soon. The exam is available through EXIN\\u2019s partner channel and EXIN Anywhere in more than 165 countries worldwide.\\nThe EXIN Ethical Hacking Foundation and EXIN Secure Programming certifications are developed in joint cooperation with Security Academy, a European training institute with its focus on Information Security, Business Continuity Management (BCM) and Security Management. The partnership with Security Academy is meant to combine hands-on, practical and job-oriented ICT security experience with EXIN\\u2019s vendor independent IT certification knowledge base, both at a high international level.\\nLike this:Like Loading...\\n\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t \\t\\tThis entry was posted on Sunday, 19 April 2015 at 11:22\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\tand is filed under Economia, Estero, Recensioni.\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\tTagged: certification, exin, expands, security. \\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\tYou can follow any responses to this entry through the RSS 2.0 feed.\\n\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\tYou can leave a response, or trackback from your own site.\\n\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\n\\n\\t\\n\\n\\t\\t\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\",\n                \"source\": \"fidest.wordpress.com\",\n                \"publishDate\": \"2015-04-19T11:22:29+02:00\",\n                \"sourceType\": \"blog\",\n                \"language\": \"en\",\n                \"googleRank\": 3,\n                \"relatedDocs\": [\n\n                ]\n            },\n            {\n                \"id\": 186521698,\n                \"url\": \"http:\\/\\/www.gulf-times.com\\/qatar\\/178\\/details\\/435549\\/%e2%80%98protecting-critical-infrastructure-key-to-qatar%e2%80%99s-cyber-security-approach%e2%80%99\",\n                \"title\": \"Protecting critical infrastructure has always been a prime objective of Qatar\\u2019s cyber security approach, HE the Minister of Information and Communications Technology Dr Hessa al-Jaber has said.\\u201cWe sta\",\n                \"content\": \"Protecting critical infrastructure has always been a prime objective of Qatar\\u2019s cyber security approach, HE the Minister of Information and Communications Technology Dr Hessa al-Jaber has said.\\u201cWe started early with the establishment of the region\\u2019s first CERT in 2008.

We have also issued various policies and regulations in line with international treaties and practices such as the 2014 cybercrime law, policies to ensure open data and transparency, and a law on personal information privacy protection will be released soon,\\u201d HE Dr al-Jaber noted.The Internet, she said, must become more resilient across nations.\\u201cWe applaud the concerted efforts of the ITU and ICANN in this regard. International co-ordination should continue in helping bridging the digital divide between nations. Governments should harmonise their jurisdictions in cyberspace through UN initiatives,\\u201d she added.HE the Minister also urged public authorities to work closely with private sectors and civil societies by engaging in open discussions, sharing information and developing public-private partnerships to enhance the protection of nations\\u2019 critical assets.Governments, she said, should build a common understanding of threats through norms and standards. Establishing a common cyber risk information exchange framework between nations will help address the challenges of predictability of cyber threats.\\u201cQatar is supporting the UN reports highlighted by the Seoul framework, which can serve as a basis to develop such an information-sharing model,\\u201d she stressed.&#13;\\n                        \",\n                \"source\": \"www.gulf-times.com\",\n                \"publishDate\": \"2015-04-19T07:53:15.665+02:00\",\n                \"sourceType\": \"web\",\n                \"language\": \"en\",\n                \"googleRank\": 7,\n                \"relatedDocs\": [\n\n                ]\n            },\n            {\n                \"id\": 186507302,\n                \"url\": \"http:\\/\\/www.moroccoworldnews.com\\/2014\\/04\\/129412\\/karima-rhanem-only-moroccan-to-take-part-in-model-united-nations-in-the-balkan\\/\",\n                \"title\": \"&#13;\\n   \\t\\t\\t\\t            \\t    &#13;\\n                &#13;\\n\\t    &#13;\\n        \\t\\t\\t&#13;\\n        \\nRabat \\u2013 Moroccan young leader Karima Rhanem will take part in the largest Model United Nations in the Bal\",\n                \"content\": \"&#13;\\n   \\t\\t\\t\\t            \\t    &#13;\\n                &#13;\\n\\t    &#13;\\n        \\t\\t\\t&#13;\\n        \\nRabat \\u2013 Moroccan young leader Karima Rhanem will take part in the largest Model United Nations in the Balkan scheduled to take place in Albania on\\u00a0May 2-5. \\nMs. Rhanem will be the only\\u00a0\\u00a0guest speaker from Morocco for the opening of the conference and a chair of the simulation of the United Nations General Assembly Disarmament and International security committee (DISEC).\\n\\u201cI am very honored to have been selected by the Balkan Model United Nations Secretariat to open the conference among other national and international personalities.

It was really hard for me in the beginning. However, once past that stage, things got so much better and I now thoroughly enjoy myself here,\\u201d he said.Tun Muhammad said not all culture shocks were negative, adding that some were actually pleasant discoveries.\\u201cThe people I met here \\u2014 local or foreigners \\u2014 are very friendly and helpful. They are not shy to greet you with a smile. I was \\u2018shocked\\u2019 by their friendliness and eagerness to help. After a while, their friendliness made me feel I am not a stranger here. And I also started greeting everyone with a smile. Their friendliness is contagious,\\u201d he said enthusiastically.He also noted that most Kiwi drivers are very polite.\\u201cThey give way to pedestrians instead of the other way round. The police are strict but very helpful and efficient. What has impressed me most is the cleanliness here. Most places are so clean that people can go barefoot everywhere \\u2013 something they do a lot of during summer on campus and other recreational places such as the beach.\\u201dA Mara-sponsored student, Tun Muhammad has been allocated NZ$1,100 per week for living expenses. However, as the cost of living in Waikato is one of the cheapest in NZ, he only has to pay NZ$70 for rental.He has been saving his weekly allowance for a flight ticket back to Malaysia every long holiday. During the university term, he goes shopping for groceries, among other necessities, and visiting friends on weekends.Since coming to NZ, this outdoors-loving Malaysian student has taken up hiking and fishing, going to the beach and skiing. Life has been good with the pristine mountains being only three hours away and the beach, even nearer.It is, thus, quite understandable that he now plans to stay on to do his Master\\u2019s at the same university.Malaysian students\\u2019 associations in NZFor fellowship and help, Malaysian students such as Tun Muhammad can always turn to the Malaysian students\\u2019 associations across New Zealand \\u2013 apart from university staff.When the Education New Zealand (ENZ) media team was invited to attend Orientation Day organised by the Otago Malaysian Students\\u2019 Association (Omsa), on March 7, it was quite a surprise to see the big hall packed with hundreds of Malaysians.It was even more impressive that Omsa was able to prepare some authentic Malaysian dishes and drinks \\u2014 Sarawak laksa and roti canai to go with either teh tarik or yam jelly.Omsa president Cheah Seng Wei, 24, a fourth-year Pharmacy student, said the association was set up in 1963.The purpose was to bring Malaysian students together, help new Malaysian students adapt and organise activities not only to make student-life in NZ more interesting but also to introduce Malaysian culture to non-Malaysians.Activities for the rest of the year include Malam Malaysia showcasing the diverse cultures of Malaysia, Malaysian Carnival and a trip to Quarantine Island.\\u201cWe\\u2019re doing all this for one main purpose \\u2014 to bring home closer to Malaysians studying in NZ,\\u201d Cheah said.Khor Sze Yuin, a third-year marketing student at the University of Canterbury, shared that when she first landed in Christchurch at 5am, it was members of the Christchurch Malaysian Students\\u2019 Association who came to meet her and help her settle in.Auckland University of Technology (AUT) student Samantha Hiew, who is cultural officer of the Auckland Malaysian Students\\u2019 Association, said there are seven such associations in the eight NZ universities.Meetings have been held for the biggest Malaysian event in NZ \\u2014 the Bersatu Games, an annual sports event where various competitions such as rugby, badminton, tennis, table tennis, football and futsal are held. For this year, there will also be a debating contest.Hiew, a third year law student, said through these games, Malaysians in NZ could come together to have a good time, and many Malaysian students actually flew to the game\\u2019s venue to participate.With a strong theme statement \\u2014 \\u2018Sail to Glory\\u2019 \\u2014 it is not surprising the Bersatu Games sees tough competition and a strong spirit among the participants.As a green country, NZ\\u2019s bins separate recyclables and organic waste.University of WaikatoLocated in the river city of Hamilton, the university is known for its beautiful 65ha campus with three ornamental lakes.Established in 1964, it is well-known as a modern and innovative university. Its academic success has placed it among the top 2 per cent of the 17,000 universities in the world, according to the European Universities\\u2019 Association \\u2014 with more than 90 per cent of its academic staff being research-active.In terms of subjects, it now has five ranked in the top 150 in the world. Its education programme has been ranked 46th in the world by the QS Subject Rankings last year while its modern languages, economics and econometrics, law and computer science and info systems were all ranked between 101 and 150.In view of growing global demand for skilled cyber security professionals at 3.5 times the pace of the overall job market, the university is the first in New Zealand to offer a Master\\u2019s degree in cyber security that trains new security professionals as well as retrains existing computer science and IT professionals to be cyber security specialists.The Master of Cyber Security course covers the technical, legal and management aspects of cyber security and addresses new topics as they emerge in cyberspace.Cyber Security Lab senior lecturer and head Dr Ryan Ko explained that the Computing and Mathematical Sciences Faculty and US\\u2019 National Aeronautics and Space Administration (Nasa) started Internet connection in New Zealand on the campus in 1989.\\u201cOur Machine Learning-Data Mining groups are world-renowned. A prominent tool used worldwide is Weka with more than three million downloads. Then, there\\u2019s the world-renowned Digital Library research group whose Greenstone Digital Library software is used in more than 60 countries,\\u201d said Ko of several of the faculty\\u2019s achievements.With alumni including big names such as Google engineering director Dr Graig Nevill-Manning and Academy Award winner John Allitt (special effects for \\u2018The Lord of The Rings\\u2019, \\u2018The Hobbit\\u2019 and \\u2018Avatar\\u2019) and a long history of winning student competitions, the faculty which has a strong applied research culture and entrepreneurial mindset is the platform for students serious about exploring cyber space.As a cyber security expert with full awareness that the skills learnt may be abused, Ko has a clear idea of where to start the cyber programmes.\\u201cWe start our courses with the teaching of ethics to lay a good foundation for our students.\\u201dBelieving strongly the world needs a software that returns control of data back to the users in view of easy data excess to hackers, apart from adopting \\u2018Return Control\\u2019 as the lab\\u2019s motto, Ko is also in the midst of developing software to allow individuals to tighten their own cyber security.Victoria UniversityKnown for its scenic hills, deep blue sea and safety, the city of Wellington is compact with every part of the city centre reachable on foot. It is a city free of traffic jams, pollution and population pressures. Though the capital city of NZ, Wellington comes across as affordable and convenient.Victoria University was chosen by the NZ government as the top university for research in 2013.Its law faculty has been named the leading law school in the country. Other specialities include foreign languages and linguistics, human geography, pure and applied mathematics, Maori knowledge and development, molecular, cellular and whole organism biology, philosophy and statistics.Globally, Victoria has been ranked among the world\\u2019s top 150 universities by the QS Subject Rankings last year in 11 subjects, including law, arts and social sciences, psychology, earth sciences and information technology. Its Business School is among the global elite group of 60 given the triple crown of international commerce accreditations.Of its total 22,000 students, 14 per cent are international students, and Victoria Business School (VBS), situated close to crucial government buildings, including the Beehive, the executive arm of NZ\\u2019s parliament, is one of the most popular in attracting foreign students.Prof John Davies said VBS\\u2019 location is self-explanatory in terms of relevance as close proximity to decision-making government departments means the school\\u2019s strength lies in the fact that it is recognised and accredited by international academic bodies or business professional associations.One-sixth of VBS students are international students with Malaysians being the third largest group after Chinese nationals and Vietnamese.Next year VBS will welcome another batch of 150 Malaysian students mainly from Kolej Yayasan Saad. The young Malaysians have just finished their foundation year at the University of Auckland and the University of Canterbury.\\u201cVBS\\u2019 partnership with overseas counterparts has not only helped enrich the cultures of NZ students but at the same time, the school is able to help produce significant numbers of qualified accountants for overseas countries such as Malaysia,\\u201d Davies said.Ko (centre) is seen at the Cyber Security Lab.Massey UniversityMassey University started off as Massey Agriculture College in 1927, and was upgraded to university status in 1964. With its roots in agriculture and food, the university has over the years earned its place as an authority in this field.In terms of agriculture, it is ranked the top in the country and 19th in the world.This state-funded university with its 80 years of tradition has also proven itself through academic excellence and outstanding performance.Housing 32,449 students, of whom some 15,000 are long distance learners and about 4,000 international students, the university has consistently been placed by QS World University Ranking in the top 3 per cent of universities in the world.Apart from agriculture, it leads the world in courses such as food technology, veterinary medicine, aviation, biotechnology, volcanology, communication and media studies, defence, accounting and finance.It is the only NZ university with a veterinary teaching hospital and the only university offering a degree in aviation.Renowned for its world-class research and achievements as the world leader in distance education, the university has international collaboration with tertiary institutions globally with 218 active international partnership agreements.Vice-chancellor Steve Maharey said the university has embraced change both from within and in the wider world to meet new needs.While continuing to build up its traditional strengths, the university also initiates new and diverse efforts to address upcoming issues such as food security.\\u201cLast century, the world faced the issue of producing more food. This has become more pressing now as food security is at the top on the agenda for most governments worldwide.\\u201cOn top of that, there is the issue of food safety, which was not so much of an issue in the last century. Sustainability of production and environmental issues have become extremely important. There are now issues of traceability and use of IT to support the food industry,\\u201d said Maharey, who is a former education minister.With agriculture and food being the university\\u2019s forte, Maharey said Massey University has much to contribute to the world in these areas as any research outcomes or new findings would not only benefit NZ but also other countries.He also highlighted the university\\u2019s efforts to find new business and economic approaches, given that the present economic model, built by the west, has been suffering from economic crises every 10 years.The university is also pushing the boundary in scientific research, and endeavouring to maintain its leading position in areas such as communications, engineering and advanced technology.To cater for the needs of Muslim students across the world, Massey University has set up an Islamic Centre by the lakeside on its main campus at Palmerston North.The project built with the grants sponsored by the Sabahan government, was initiated by a Malaysian \\u2014 Associate Prof Alex Chu \\u2014 who was also a former Massey lecturer.ConclusionElijah Wood, the lead actor of \\u2018The Lord of the Rings\\u2019 trilogy once said: \\u201cThere\\u2019s a real purity in New Zealand that does not exist in the US. It is actually not an easy thing to find in our world any more. It\\u2019s a unique place because it is so far away from the rest of the world. There is a sense of isolation and also being protected.\\u201dWood was quite right.Situated in the far south, away from the rest of the world, NZ has been well protected by the Pacific Ocean and has grown into a mature country with style, personality and its own way of doing things.The country can be strange in the eyes of those familiar with other parts of the world but to those preferring natural beauty, simplicity and traditional values, it is a paradise. NZ may be isolated physically but it\\u2019s not alone academically with all its universities establishing partnerships with different educational institutions across the globe.Powered by traditional values of upholding truth, kindness and beauty, there is a general spirit of seeking excellence, which has put all its universities on the list of world-renowned tertiary institutions.For students seeking a unique experience as residents and a world-class qualification, NZ is a country that can offer both.International students will enjoy NZ\\u2019s many scenic gems.\",\n                \"source\": \"www.theborneopost.com\",\n                \"publishDate\": \"2015-04-18T19:52:35.438+02:00\",\n                \"sourceType\": \"blog\",\n                \"language\": \"en\",\n                \"googleRank\": 6,\n                \"relatedDocs\": [\n\n                ]\n            },\n            {\n                \"id\": 186464684,\n                \"url\": \"http:\\/\\/news.windowstorussia.com\\/the-usa-and-china-contradiction-growth-in-security-sphere-in-the-apr.html\",\n                \"title\": \"&#13;\\n&#13;\\nWith Chinese building up comprehensive national power, a variety of contradictions between Beijing and Washington are continuously expanding.

Over the period of more than twenty years of \\u2018unipolar moment\\u2019 existence, the United States of America, having accustomed to their unchallenged dominance in global and regional matters, are not ready to accept the right of another state to \\u2018shape the future of the world\\u2019 on an equal basis with Washington. Washington evermore intends to continue setting the tone of global development, to prescribe remedies for economic prosperity and to dictate rules of \\u2018appropriate\\u2019 behavior to other states both in international and internal domestic affairs, which can\\u2019t but trigger quite understandable irritation and resistance on the part of the strengthening Beijing.\\nContrary to official eloquence of the US and China senior officials, and their public claptrap on strengthening of bilateral cooperation and possible development of \\u2018relations of a new type between the Great Powers\\u2019, in reality there is an increase of rivalry and contradictions in the American-Chinese relations. If at the beginning of XXI century the \\u2018negative\\u2019 agenda included the Taiwan issue, human rights discourse (Tibetan and Uighur issues, the problem of Chinese dissidents, freedom of speech, etc.) and a range of economic problems, then in the last few years in record-breaking time this list of contradictions was supplemented by a range of problems related to the South China and the East China Seas, cyber security issues, freedom of Internet in China, the situation in Hong Kong, and also intensifying rivalry between the two countries in the APR, as well as at other regional venues (the Middle East, Africa, Latin America, etc.).\\nWidening of the spheres of contradictions between the USA and China lends evidence for the thesis on the inevitability of rivalry between a firmly established state \\u2013 global leader and a potential super-power rapidly expanding its might, both of which drastically differ in ideology, value system, political and economic model.\\nIn this relation the augmentation of the American-Chinese contradictions in security sphere in the APR is extremely indicative. The both states which since the beginning of XXI century have boosted their involvement in this region\\u2019s affairs give each other a handle for grounded concern and building up of distrust.\\nBeijing\\u2019s growing discontent and deep concern is related to the US intervention since summer 2010 into territorial disputes in the South China and the East China Seas, to strengthening by Washington of the military alliances and formation of new partner relations in the APR (in particular, Washington\\u2019s \\u2018drawing over to its side\\u2019 of such key Asian countries as Vietnam and Myanmar), to the American policy for China demonization, to the intensification of the US joint exercises in this region, to the US continuing intelligence-gathering activities in close vicinity to China\\u2019s territory. Behind the events in Hong Kong, Beijing also sees the US\\u2019 purposeful activities in accordance with the proven scheme of triggering \\u2018colored\\u2019 revolutions, aimed in this case at destabilization of the situation in China and erosion of the CPC legitimacy. Beijing often interprets the majority of critical situations which China currently faces in its internal and external policy, as a result of measures implemented by Washington to deter China.\\nFor Washington there are also more and more issues for concern in relation to the current situation in the security sphere in the APR. Now it is hard to deny the fact that China becomes a new centre of power and influence in the APR. Chinese defense budget demonstrates sustainable growth in absolute terms (in 2015 defense expenditures will grow by 10.1% compared to 2014 and will amount to USD 142 bn), China\\u2019s war potential is considerably consolidating, operating capabilities of its armed forces keep growing, China\\u2019s push in implementation of its national interests also increases.\\nIncidents with the Chinese and American marine vessels and aircraft standoffs in the water areas around China and aerial domains over them have long become common occurrence. China, upholding the principle of absolute ban for foreign war ships\\u2019 navigation within the 200-mile exclusive economic zone of a coastal state, disturbs the American ships\\u2019 navigation in its exclusive economic zone and sometimes outside it. Yet another incident took place in August 2014, when a Chinese fighter aircraft Su-27 impeded the navigation of an American maritime patrol aircraft P-8 flying at the distance of 145 miles from the Chinese Hainan Island. By contrast with the similar incident which ended up in the plane collision and the death of the Chinese pilot, the August incident was without losses and resulted only in protests on the American part.\\nA peculiar response to the continuing intelligence operations by the American Navy and Air Force in the Chinese exclusive economic zone was introduction by China since 2012 of the practice of conducting military maneuvers within the limits of the US exclusive economic zone, in particular in the area of Guam and Hawaii islands in the Pacific Ocean. Such maneuvers became possible due to enhancement of Chinese armed forces\\u2019 operational capabilities. Increased capabilities of the China\\u2019s fleet to overpass \\u2018the first island chain\\u2019 and enter the Pacific Ocean unhindered were demonstrated in July 2013, when for the first time in history Chinese ships sailed through the La Perouse Strait located between the Sakhalin and Hokkaido islands. At the end of March 2015 another showcase incident took place: for the first time the Chinese Air Force crossed \\u2018the first island chain\\u2019 and held maneuvers in the Western part of the Pacific Ocean. Prospectively, one can predict further expansion of military exercise level and the increase of the number of China\\u2019s maneuvers in the Western part of the Pacific Ocean near the American territory with all that it implies.\\nRapid strengthening of China\\u2019s military power is accompanied by Beijing\\u2019s attempts to spread its control over navigable and air routes in the APR. The creation by China of the air defense identification zone in the East China Sea in November 2013 was the first signal, which caused a massive outcry in the region and an extremely negative response on the part of the USA. The second signal followed at the end of March 2015, when China, without relevant coordination with the interested parties, officially opened a new air route M503, only 8 km away from the West of the Taiwan Strait water parting line. Such proximity of the new air route to transportation corridors of Taiwan, the US long-standing partner in the region, can obstruct both civil and military operations for Taiwan, in particular, affect communication between Taiwan and Taiwan-controlled islands of Kinmen and Matsu.\\nWashington also shows deep concern in view of Beijing\\u2019s spinning-up activities in vindicating its claims for disputed islands and water zones of the South China Sea. In 2014, Beijing designated its new tactics in materialization of territorial claims: China undertakes extraordinary in scale and unprecedented in speed works on the creation of artificial islands in the South China Sea. Over the past year China constructed through sluicing at least five artificial islands. In mid-November 2013, Jane\\u2019s Defense Weekly made public satellite images of the construction of the Jongshu Island that was even then larger, in terms of area, than Taiwan-controlled Itu Aba \\u2013 the largest natural island of the Spratly Islands. In February 2015, the world community\\u2019s attention was drawn to sluicing by China of the Yunsidao Island \\u2013 the largest in the group of the Paracel Islands. Compared to 2013, the island area almost doubled. The construction of new islands and the enlargement of those already existing can considerably strengthen China\\u2019s positions in the South China Sea, which is certainly in conflict with the US interests.\\nAnd finally, contradictions between the USA and China can reach their pinnacle in relation to the actively promoted by China idea of creating a new regional security system in the APR, that should replace the currently functioning system based primarily on the bilateral allied relations between the USA and the five countries of the region. On the basis of statements from Chinese high officials, heard throughout the last year, Washington has come to the conclusion that Beijing intends to bolster the creation of the new system of regional security without the US\\u2019 participation under the principle \\u2018Asia for Asians\\u2019.\\nYana\\u00a0Leksyutina, Dr. Sc., Associate Professor at Saint-Petersburg State University,\\u00a0exlusively\\u00a0for the online magazine\\u00a0\\u201cNew Eastern Outlook.\\u201c \\nArticle source: http:\\/\\/journal-neo.org\\/2015\\/04\\/17\\/rus-ssha-i-kitaj-rost-protivorechij-v-sfere-bezopasnosti-v-atr\\/&#13;\\n&#13;\\n&#13;\\n\",\n                \"source\": \"news.windowstorussia.com\",\n                \"publishDate\": \"2015-04-18T18:10:39+02:00\",\n                \"sourceType\": \"blog\",\n                \"language\": \"en\",\n                \"googleRank\": 3,\n                \"relatedDocs\": [\n\n                ]\n            },\n            {\n                \"id\": 186433327,\n                \"url\": \"http:\\/\\/polforumblogroll.blogspot.com\\/2015\\/04\\/fwd-grendelreport-hackers-not-suicide.html\",\n                \"title\": \"\\n                                            \\u00a0Israeli Cyber Expert: Hackers, Not Suicide Bombers, Will Cause Next 9\\/11The next 9\\/11-style terror attack will be perpetrated by hackers infiltrating an a\",\n                \"content\": \"\\n                                            \\u00a0Israeli Cyber Expert: Hackers, Not Suicide Bombers, Will Cause Next 9\\/11The next 9\\/11-style terror attack will be perpetrated by hackers infiltrating an air traffic control system or other critical infrastructure, according to\\u00a0Col. (res.) Dr. Gabi Siboni,\\u00a0director of the Cyber Security Program at Israel's Institute for National Security Studies (INSS). The Times of Israel reported \\u00a0on Siboni's assessment Wednesday.\\\"Computer hackers have begun targeting electric and nuclear power plants and other critical operations around the world in audacious and continuous efforts to take control of them.\\\" \\u2026\\\"The next 9\\/11 will happen without suicide bombers aboard the plane with box-cutters but will occur because of a cyber incident perpetrated by a terror organization,\\\" he said.\\\"Cyber aggression is widely utilized and has become a basic weapon used in international conflicts. Countries are responsible for attacks on most national infrastructure, and governments across the Western world have understood that they must allocate resources not only to purchase new tanks and aerial defense systems but also in defensive cyber infrastructure,\\\" he added.Siboni offered his assessment in advance of an American-Israel cybersecurity conference scheduled to take place later this\\u00a0month in Washington D.C. Siboni called on the United States and Israel to increase their cooperation in order to counter this threat.Last year saw major multinational corporations investing in Israel's growing cyber-security hub.\\u00a0This past\\u00a0October \\u00a0The Washington Post reported that Israel had become the number two exporter of cyber products and was becoming a \\\"cybersecurity superpower.\\\" In February, The New York Times reported that the United States was increasingly turning to allies Britain and Israel to counter the cyber threats emanating from Iran.Illustrating how \\\"[c]yber aggression\\\" has become a weapon utilized in conflicts, Claudia Rosett wrote in How Iran and North Korea Became Cyber-Terror Buddies, which was published in the January 2015 issue of The Tower Magazine:The Sony hack has monopolized media attention over the past month, and finally aroused public concern over the cyber-warfare capabilities of rogue states like North Korea. There are signs of Iranian involvement in the attack, but no conclusive evidence. There is conclusive evidence, however, of far-ranging collaboration between North Korea and Iran on cyber-warfare and numerous other forms of military technology.These go far beyond the realm of cyberspace. They include such devastating conventional weapons as ballistic missiles and\\u2014most importantly\\u2014the development of nuclear technology and nuclear weapons. Clearly, the relationship between these two rogue totalitarian states represents a clear and present danger to the entire free world.The really important question, then, is not precisely who hacked Sony's computer network. It is what we might see if the administration rolled back the curtain and showed us whatever it knows about the full extent of North Korea's rogue ventures, especially its long-standing romance with Iran.[Photo: iloque \\/ Flickr ]\\u00a0\\u00a0                            __._,_.___                                                                                                                                                              __,_._,___            --   --   Thanks for being part of \\\"PoliticalForum\\\" at Google Groups.

Despite this shift in consumer sentiment, the research revealed consumers are not taking necessary precautions to protect their personal information. When asked what measures they are implementing to better safeguard their information online, the majority (76 percent) of respondents said they had merely implemented stronger passwords \\u2014 a step that is typically required when setting up an online account. A significant 20 percent said they aren\\u2019t doing anything at all. It is no question the cyber threat environment remains dynamic and dangerous, and is gaining in severity. According to a recent report released by the Identity Theft Resource Center (ITRC), companies in the U.S. experienced a record-breaking 783 data breaches in 2014.\\u00a0Already in 2015 this trend has continued with the Anthem Health security breach \\u2014 the largest in history, affecting more than 80 million of its customers, as well as Sony, TV Monde and others.\\u00a0Many of these attacks were initiated by sophisticated hackers looking for ways to circumvent perimeter defenses through compromised devices, while others originated from within the network through unsuspecting employees or partners who, without malicious intent, let cyber criminals in. \\u201cThe amount of entry points cyber criminals can use to infiltrate corporate networks and steal precious information is growing rapidly, as the number of devices connected to the network increase,\\u201d said Andrew Del Matto, chief financial officer at Fortinet. \\u201cIf consumers aren\\u2019t taking precautions to protect their devices and proprietary data in their personal lives, it is unlikely they are doing so at work, increasing the possibility of a breach. It is more critical now than ever before for businesses to help safeguard the consumer and customer data for which they are responsible. They must take a multi-layered approach to security to protect against both malicious and non-malicious threats, from both inside and outside of the network.\\u201d Most Consumers Trust No One When It Comes to Protecting Personal InformationOn a scale of one-to-five with one being \\u201ccompletely \\u2026.. \\nRead the full article: http:\\/\\/money.cnn.com\\/news\\/newsfeeds\\/articles\\/marketwire\\/11G038880-001.htm (only 1\\/3 of the full article is shown) \\u00a0&#13;\\n&#13;\\nPlease note: SentiRate is not responsible for the accuracy, legality, decency of material or copyright compliance of any Linked Site or services or information provided via any Linked Site.

It is far from the UK, almost in Africa, but by dint of history \\u2013 initially in the Treaty of Utrecht but through many subsequent agreements, reluctant or otherwise\\u2013 it has been British for 300 years. Strategically important during the Second World War, it has now become economically very important to a lot of companies.\\n\\n\\tIt has become an epicentre of the electronic gambling industry, with almost 30 companies licensed to operate there. It is home to a large number of financial services and shipping companies. This has undoubtedly been influenced by its low tax regime; but don\\u2019t fall for the hype \\u2013 it is a rigorously enforced regime, compliant with more European directives than many of its neighbours.\\n\\n\\tIts location means it is a natural gateway both to Europe and to Africa. These may be among the factors apparently insulating it from the world\\u2019s economic downturn, through which it continued to grow albeit at a slower rate than before. It\\u2019s growing its software industry and angling its tourism to ensure longer visits from people at different times of the year. It\\u2019s tiny allright \\u2013 but its prospects have never been so.\\n\\n\\tDownload the PDF here. \\n     &#13;\\n  &#13;\\n&#13;\\n&#13;\\n&#13;\\n&#13;\\n&#13;\\n  \\n  \\n    &#13;\\n            \\n\\t\\n\\n\\tBring Your Own Device \\n\\n\\tHow mobile technology is revolutionising the workplace.\\n\\n\\tHow are you reading this web page?

As part of the wider economy it employs 2,000 people. From a total population of 30,000 this is significant.\\n\\n\\n\\t\\tThose employees mostly live on the Rock and they in turn fuel the other parts of the economy. They buy and rent homes, they shop, they use transport.\\u00a0\\n\\n\\t\\t\\u00a0\\n\\n\\t\\tIt\\u2019s not just the people either - e-gaming has started pulling through other industries in its wake. One thing utterly crucial in a regulated environment like gambling is a completely robust technical infrastructure. Gibtelecom has built a powerful communications network partly because the gaming industry has demanded it - and it\\u2019s now solid enough for financial services to reside on it.\\u00a0\\n\\n\\t\\t\\u00a0\\n\\n\\t\\tE-gaming used to happen only on desktop computers. In recent years there has been a proliferation of smartphones and tablets, resulting in a fledgeling software design industry around the e-gaming partners on the rock. The industry is actually a powerful catalyst for a great deal else - \\u00a0this supplement explores how it works.\\n\\n\\n\\t07 October 2013\\n\\n     &#13;\\n  &#13;\\n&#13;\\n&#13;\\n&#13;\\n&#13;\\n&#13;\\n  \\n  \\n    &#13;\\n            \\n\\n\\t\\t\\n\\n\\t\\t\\u00a0\\n\\n\\t\\t\\u201cMy principal argument is that after sixty years [of inaction] we really need to get on with something.\\u201d So said Graham Brady MP during a New Statesman-hosted round table debate on aviation capacity earlier this summer. Sir Roy McNulty, chairman of Gatwick Airport (our partner in putting together this supplement) agreed, describing the need as \\u201cstaringly obvious\\u201d while Adam Marshall of the British Chambers of \\u00a0Commerce talked of \\u201cmassive constraint\\u201d.\\n\\n\\t\\t\\u00a0\\n\\n\\t\\tGovernment figures suggest 35 million passengers will be left grounded every year from 2050 if the status quo remains.\\n\\n\\t\\tSo far, so consensual. But while the prognosis is broadly, if not universally, agreed, the nature of the cure divides opinion. The discussion to date has been underwritten by a series of assumptions about the future shape of air travel.

These issues are nothing new \\u2013 as our history essay on page 10 shows, since the beginnings of the\\n\\n\\t\\t\\trelationship in the 1900s it\\u2019s been a rocky road with frequent tiffs and accusations of bribery, misogyny and excessive influence.\\n\\n\\t\\t\\t\\u00a0\\n\\n\\t\\t\\tWhile Ed Miliband and Len McCluskey have been fighting it out on the front pages, behind the scenes much hard work has been taking place to represent members\\u2019 interests \\u2013 whether it\\u2019s fighting to save jobs and wages, supporting food banks or campaigning against draconian welfare reforms and cuts to much needed public services.\\n\\n\\t\\t\\t\\u00a0\\n\\n\\t\\t\\tHowever, little media attention has been afforded to this aspect of what unions do, thus hindering public understanding of what they achieve. Consequently the unions suffer from what could be described as an image problem. We look at what could be done to address this on page 16.\\n\\n\\t\\t\\t\\u00a0\\n\\n\\t\\t\\tAnd of course, we have our guide: detailed listings of Britain\\u2019s unions, international counterparts and other useful contacts.\\n\\n\\n\\t\\t9 September 2013\\n\\n\\n     &#13;\\n  &#13;\\n&#13;\\n&#13;\\n&#13;\\n&#13;\\n&#13;\\n  \\n  \\n    &#13;\\n            \\n\\t\\n\\n\\t\\u00a0\\n\\n\\n\\t\\tWe live in a digital world. Eighty three per cent of the UK population is online and the demand for virtual services is growing at an ever-quickening pace. So when the question \\u201cWhere is our data?\\u201d was posed at a New Statesman-hosted round table earlier in the summer, there was both a simple answer to the question and some complexities to untangle.\\n\\n\\t\\t\\u00a0\\n\\n\\t\\tThe simple answer is that most of our data is housed in data centres. To proponents, including former cabinet minister Steven Norris (see interview on page 28), data centres are the factories of the digital age. This supplement acts in part as a beginner\\u2019s guide: the schematic overleaf, explains how they work while the jargon buster on page 30 provides some essential definitions.\\n\\n\\t\\t\\u00a0\\n\\n\\t\\tThe complexity surrounds security, privacy, energy supply, power consumption and a looming skills shortage \\u2013 and these themes are addressed across the following pages. Despite the centrality of data centres to much of the nation\\u2019s cultural, social and economic activity, awareness remains limited. Government remains confused, says Norris. This supplement is a contribution to the demystification process.\\n\\n\\n\\t2 September 2013\\n\\n     &#13;\\n  &#13;\\n&#13;\\n&#13;\\n&#13;\\n&#13;\\n&#13;\\n  \\n  \\n    &#13;\\n            \\n\\t\\n\\n\\n\\t\\tTurn to page 5 of this guide and you will see an image of the infamous Edvard Munch painting, The Scream, being auctioned at Sotheby\\u2019s in May 2012. One of four versions of the painting created by Munch, it is the only one that is privately owned. It sold for more than \\u00a380m. Art as an investment is becoming increasingly popular. As too are investments in antiques, race horses, venture capital funds, real estate, jewellery, forests and other such alternative asset classes.\\n\\n\\t\\t\\u00a0\\n\\n\\t\\tThe increasing interest is, in the main, the result of economic uncertainty and investors\\u2019 desire to look beyond traditional vehicles. It could also be said that there is a growing appreciation of the value \\u2013 and satisfaction \\u2013 of turning passions into profit.\\n\\n\\t\\t\\u00a0\\n\\n\\t\\tAlternative investment strategies can be risky. They often involve putting faith into fledging companies, the need for a horse to cross a finish line first or being left at the mercy of the weather as those investing in vineyards are. However, they can also offer the opportunity to diversify, generate returns and invest in items of personal interest. What better than buying a painting to enjoy while also benefiting (one hopes) from the increasing value?\\n\\n\\n\\t5 August 2013\\n\\n     &#13;\\n  &#13;\\n&#13;\\n&#13;\\n&#13;\\n&#13;\\n&#13;\\n  \\n  \\n    &#13;\\n            \\n\\t\\n\\n\\n\\t\\tAlthough the health needs of the UK have changed dramatically since the inception of the NHS, our health-care system remains largely unchanged. This leaves us with a National Health Service that is designed to meet the needs of a society that no longer exists. There is wide agreement that the NHS needs to prioritise preventative care to take the strain off front-line services.\\n\\n\\t\\t\\u00a0\\n\\n\\t\\tIn the 20th century, before the NHS, many urban local councils started off as \\u201clocal boards of health\\u201d, then becoming district councils, and local authorities. At each stage of reorganisation these bodies lost a little bit more of their role in health until today the care they mostly deliver is adult social care and children's services; any other health care is delivered by other bodies.\\n\\n\\t\\t\\u00a0\\n\\n\\t\\tThe Health and Social Care Act has placed a large emphasis on local government driving improvements in public health with a renewed focus on prevention. With responsibility for public health having being transferred from the NHS to local government on 1 April this year, we can expect our health landscape to change quite dramatically. Local government seems to be rising to the challenge and coming up with some innovative solutions but it is difficult to see the scale of its aspiration to drive change and deliver innovative health services.\\n\\n\\t\\t\\u00a0\\n\\n\\t\\tLabour is proposing a single holistic system, integrating physical, mental and social care. To deliver this, local government would hold an integrated budget for most health and social care services \\u2013 likely to amount to about \\u00a389bn. But are local governments really capable of commissioning and delivering these ambitious plans?\\n\\n\\n\\t22 July 2013\\n\\n     &#13;\\n  &#13;\\n&#13;\\n&#13;\\n&#13;\\n&#13;\\n&#13;\\n  \\n  \\n    &#13;\\n            \\n\\t\\n\\n\\n\\t\\tEncouraging more small and medium-sized businesses (SMEs) to export is a practical rather than an abstract challenge for this country. It is a necessary outcome if the UK is going to build a new economic settlement where old assumptions about Western dominance are challenged by the reality presented by emerging economic powers from China to Brazil, from India to West Africa.\\n\\t\\t\\u00a0\\n\\n\\t\\tToday there are 4.8m SMEs in the UK yet 80 per cent currently do not trade overseas. In some cases there are specific reasons why exporting fails to make sense but for most a series of inhibitors are preventing these firms from benefiting from the advantages of exporting they understand only too well.\\n\\t\\t\\u00a0\\n\\n\\t\\tThis New Statesman supplement, in association with Barclays, explores these issues. At its heart is a round table discussion featuring the Business Secretary Vince Cable and a supporting cast of journalists, business leaders, economists and entrepreneurs. Elsewhere one of Cable\\u2019s predecessors\\n\\n\\t\\tMichael Heseltine, an entrepreneur in his own right, offers his own prescription for growth (page 10). Chuka Umunna, Labour\\u2019s shadow business secretary, reports back from a recent trip to West Africa and implores the UK to unlock the potential of diaspora communities back here (page 14).\\n\\n\\t\\tThe British \\u201cbrand\\u201d is strong, he writes.

These are just a few of the health and social care challenges that Palestinians living in the occupied territories face every day \\u2013 challenges that threaten their lives, liberty and security.\\n\\n\\t\\u00a0\\n\\n\\tTo explore ways in which this crisis can be addressed, the New Statesman, with the support of the charity Medical Aid for Palestinians, held a round-table discussion with leading commentators. The conversation was informed, considered and animated as our participants debated the critical questions facing Palestinians.\\n\\t\\u00a0\\n\\n\\tFor instance, what are the main obstacles to health and medical care in Palestine and how can these best be tackled? Until a solution to these difficulties can be found, how can Palestine meet its health and medical needs? What steps can be taken to help unify the health-care system in Gaza and the West Bank? What impact does aid dependency have on Palestine\\u2019s ability to become a sustainable state? What role can the international\\n\\n\\tcommunity play to ensure that the region becomes sustainable? What impact has the UN bid had in situ? Have the Israeli elections, which took place in January, affected the situation on the ground?\\n\\n\\t\\u00a0\\n\\n\\tThere were no easy answers. With the Palestinian health and social care system unequivocally linked to the political situation, it was felt that long-lasting improvements could be made only if Israel and Palestine can resolve their conflict. Whether this presents itself as a one- or a two-state solution was the focus of much of our guests\\u2019 discussion, as was the role of the various actors on the world stage.\\n\\n\\t03 June 2013\\n\\n\\tDownload the PDF here\\n     &#13;\\n  &#13;\\n&#13;\\n&#13;\\n&#13;\\n&#13;\\n&#13;\\n  \\n  \\n    &#13;\\n            \\n\\t\\n\\n\\tWe\\u2019ve all seen the headlines that portray those on benefit as scroungers; we\\u2019ve most likely all heard ministers question the fairness for hardworking people having to foot the bill for the unemployed who \\u201csleep off a life on benefit\\u201d; and most of us will know someone who believes that poverty is the fault of the individual \\u2013 or who will argue that poverty doesn\\u2019t even exist in this country.\\n\\n\\tHow accurate are such perceptions? Are the views presented based on fact, or is it the case that evidence and statistics have been misused, misrepresented and manipulated to create propaganda for a war on welfare? And what effect do these attitudes have on those who are living below the poverty line?\\n\\n\\t\\u00a0\\n\\n\\tResearch has shown that myths and misunderstandings fuel stereotypes that negatively impact those living in poverty in the UK.

More people live longer, but more people are living with long-term conditions that affect their health (estimates say more than 15 million). The government's Health and Social Care Bill requires the NHS to make efficiency savings of 4 per cent per year \\u2013 the equivalent of \\u00a320bn of savings by 2015.\\n\\n\\t\\u00a0\\n\\n\\tWith such a significant reduction in NHS funding, how can we maintain the current level of services?\\n\\n\\t\\u00a0\\n\\n\\tA report by Sir Derek Wanless indicates that the two key variables which could affect the levels of funding required are the extent to which the NHS is able to achieve greater levels of productivity, and how far the general public becomes engaged with its own health, contributing to preventing disease rather than just treating it. Participants at our round table event explored how the NHS can maintain the standards of care it aspires to, while\\n\\n\\tresponding to the efficiency savings which have been imposed.\\n\\n\\t14 January 2013\\n\\n\\tDownload the PDF here\\n     &#13;\\n  &#13;\\n&#13;\\n&#13;\\n&#13;\\n&#13;\\n&#13;\\n  \\n  \\n    &#13;\\n            \\n\\t\\n\\n\\tIt is two years since changes to university tuition fees prompted thousands of students to take to the streets in protest. While the noise has quietened down, the impact of the hike in fees is still being felt \\u2013 not least in that it has contributed to the increasing politicisation of a generation of teenagers, according to the Political Studies Association (p10). It believes this is one of the influences driving year-on-year increases in the number\\n\\tof applications to study politics.\\n\\tBut as the other articles within this guide show, it is not simply interest in politics that is encouraging people to enrol on these courses. A degree in politics will stand graduates in good stead for rewarding and challenging careers in a variety of sectors and industries, not just within Westminster \\u2013 as our contributors demonstrate (p4-9).\\n\\tFinally, for those readers who have been suitably inspired to apply to university, either after their A-levels or as a mature student, our listings guide will help individuals find the right course for them.\\n\\n\\t17 December 2012\\n\\n\\tDownload the PDF here\\n     &#13;\\n  &#13;\\n&#13;\\n&#13;\\n&#13;\\n&#13;\\n&#13;\\n  \\n  \\n    &#13;\\n            \\n\\t\\n\\n\\tThe success or failure of vaccination programmes is about much more than simply science. Even when science can provide an effective vaccine with almost no side effects, to achieve \\u201cherd\\u201d or community immunity requires high vaccination rates. Only when enough people are vaccinated can we prevent a disease from taking hold in a community and provide immunity for those who are most vulnerable or who are not able to be vaccinated.\\n\\tThe UK is considered to be one of the leading countries in the world for vaccine policy and implementation and this supplement looks at the main issues that could risk destabilising the progress and development. On page 4, Shazia Sheikh looks at the varying success rates for the different approaches around Europe to meningitis C immunisation and identifies what the UK is doing right. On page 6, our round table participants consider the challenges ahead, in the context of the Health and Social Care Act; looking at issues around education and the way information is given to the public, and the perception of vaccine side effects, which is borne out of peoples\\u2019 trust and confidence in healthcare professionals. The discussion also\\n\\tlooks at the importance of partnerships between biotechnology companies, academia, pharmaceutical companies, governments and charities to stay ahead of the curve in vaccine policy.\\n\\tOn page 12, Liam Donaldson looks at the role of the UK in global public health. Child health specialists Dr David Elliman and Dr Helen Bedford look at public confidence in vaccines on page 13.

Equally challenging, for policymakers and financial institutions at least, is how to develop the policies, products and services that will support the UK\\u2019s entrepreneurs.\\n\\n\\tFor some, the answer lies in equity finance. However, the combination of high levels of risk, information irregularities, steep due diligence and high compliance costs can make it difficult for smaller companies to access this type of funding. Others believe innovative funding mechanisms, such as peer-to-peer finance and crowd-funding, hold thekey. Relatively new to the market, these rely on the generosity of individuals or the collective cooperation of a group of people to get a project or company off the ground. Meanwhile, venture capital, angel investors and supply chain finance also have their own individual roles to play.\\n\\tTo assess how to address the challenge of access to finance, New Statesman, in partnership with ACCA, hosted a series of party conference fringe events. However, as the discussions were to illustrate, there is no one-size-fits-all solution.\\n\\n\\t3 December 2012\\n\\n\\tDownload the PDF here\\n     &#13;\\n  &#13;\\n&#13;\\n&#13;\\n&#13;\\n&#13;\\n&#13;\\n  \\n  \\n    &#13;\\n            \\n\\t\\n\\n\\tJohn Maynard Keynes once said that the importance of money flows from it being a link between the present and the future. Nowhere is this observation more relevant than when thinking about pensions. And yet, despite the need to plan for their future financial security and wellbeing, British people are woefully unprepared. Gone are the days where saving is the norm. Today, around 11 million people are failing to save enough to achieve a pension income they are likely to want or expect in retirement.\\n\\n\\tIn part, this shift in attitude has been the result of low unemployment, falling interest rates and the influx of cheap credit in the 1990s. But other\\n\\tfactors are also at play: higher education fees, a chaotic jobs market and the rising cost of housing have influenced perceptions of the affordability\\n\\tof saving, while the economic crisis, mis-selling of products and fixing of interest rates have impacted upon trust and confidence in private finance\\n\\tproducts.\\n\\n\\tTo assess how to address the pensions challenge, New Statesman, in partnership with Aviva, hosted a series of party conference fringe events.\\n\\tHowever, as the panellists were to discover, there was no easy answer.\\n\\n\\t26 November 2012\\n\\n\\tDownload the PDF here\\n     &#13;\\n  &#13;\\n&#13;\\n&#13;\\n&#13;\\n&#13;\\n&#13;\\n  \\n  \\n    &#13;\\n            \\n\\t\\n\\n\\n\\tThe coalition government is committed to investing a significant amount of money in green technologies and jobs between now and 2015. However, it is important to realise that this alone cannot transform Britain into a low-carbon economy. Given that 95 per cent of companies in the UK are small enterprises, it is imperative to engage these organisations in the emerging green economy and foster entrepreneurialism. .\\n\\n\\tTo address this issue, the New Statesman, in partnership with Shell and Demos, held a series of fringe events at the recent party conferences. The discussion, the highlights of which have been written up for the benefit of readers within these pages, focused on what the government can do to help and encourage small and medium-sized green enterprises and the extent to which big businesses have a responsibility to nurture them. There was agreement between many of our panellists that appropriate funding is key to success. Without it, there will be little chance for UK businesses to fine-tune their ideas or take an international leadership role.\\n\\n\\tThis is an issue not only for the banks, which have proved risk averse when it comes to lending to green businesses, but also for government. The Green Investment Bank, for example, is a good idea in principle but fails to address the funding needs of the small businesses that will shape our future.\\n\\n\\t07 November 2011\\n\\n\\t\\u00a0\\n     &#13;\\n  &#13;\\n&#13;\\n&#13;\\n&#13;\\n&#13;\\n&#13;\\n  \\n  \\n    &#13;\\n            \\n\\t\\n\\n\\n\\tThe near collapse of the euro, massive public spending cuts, protests, strikes, the scandals involving the media. Studying politics now is probably more exciting than ever.\\n\\n\\tAs the world changes at rapid pace, people need to be able to understand and analyse developments. Which politicians and policies have the most impact on our lives? What are the strengths and limitations of democracy? How are rules and regulations determined? Whether readers want a policy role within the civil service, to campaign for change through a position at an NGO or have aspirations to be prime minister, a political studies course can set them on the right path.\\n\\n\\tThis guide aims to point students in the right direction. It starts by setting the scene in British politics today, followed by insights into the way the system works and what a career in politics might entail. Finally, we offer a comprehensive listings guide to help prospective students find the right course for them.\\n\\n\\t21 November 2011\\n\\n\\t\\u00a0\\n     &#13;\\n  &#13;\\n&#13;\\n&#13;\\n&#13;\\n&#13;\\n&#13;\\n  \\n  \\n    &#13;\\n            \\n\\t\\n\\n\\n\\tAfter much delay and anticipation, the government\\u2019s Open Public Services white paper, published in July 2011, sets out how it intends to improve and modernise our public services. By \\u201cputting choice and control in the hands of individuals and neighbourhoods\\u201d, it believes it can make public services more responsive to people\\u2019s needs. It is applying five key principles: increased choice; decentralising power to the \\u201clowest appropriate level\\u201d; diversity \\u2013 public services should be open to a range of providers; fair access to services; accountability \\u2013 our public services should be accountable to service users and taxpayers. .\\n\\n\\tIt all sounds like something we might be able to sign up to. However, choice requires that people are informed in a way that they understand and can use to bring about positive benefits for themselves. Choice needs to be genuine rather than simply a variety of providers offering the same services. And if we are having diversity, will all choices be available to all people in all areas? Will people be able to buy in services from their neighbouring local authority if what they want isn\\u2019t offered in their area?\\n\\n\\tCharities will be given more opportunities to bid for government money. Trustees and charity managers will have to make some careful decisions. However, are charities ready to deliver the types of public services that government wants and the public needs? While many are already having success, others will not have the skills, experience or capital to do the job at the scale that is being asked of them.\\n\\n\\t09 January 2012\\n\\n\\t\\u00a0\\n     &#13;\\n  &#13;\\n&#13;\\n&#13;\\n&#13;\\n&#13;\\n&#13;\\n  \\n  \\n    &#13;\\n            \\n\\t\\n\\n\\n\\tModern society is facing a dilemma. Demand for energy is increasing but traditional generation resources are diminishing. A rising number of homes and businesses are producing their own solar and wind power, while decentralised energy storage technologies need to be integrated. And on top of all of this, greenhouse gas emissions need to be dramatically reduced over the next few decades.\\n\\n\\tHow to address these challenges is something many energy, IT and government experts have been investing considerable time and, yes, energy in, and some of the new technologies and business models that are emerging as a result are discussed within these pages.\\n\\n\\tHowever, a successful transformation of our energy sector is dependent on all parties working together: the private sector, government and significantly the public.

The NHS needs to deliver unprecedented productivity gains over the next few years. Many of the changes, such as enhancing the role of local authorities in the health system, giving health-care providers greater autonomy, and radically reforming commissioning to further involve GPs, have the potential to improve care for patients and to enhance the performance of the NHS. .\\n\\n\\tHowever, the Bill will also introduce a step change in implementing market-based principles in the health system, with the aim of improving diversity of supply, promoting competition, and increasing choice for patients. While the NHS needs to change, if the scale of change is too big, and the speed too fast, its performance during the transition could be affected unfavourably, disadvantaging patients instead of improving their care and their life chances.\\n\\n\\tContributors to this supplement consider how increasing competition in the NHS will affect us. We look at the relationship between citizens and the state and whether the original NHS values can be refounded within this new, broader agenda. How much choice will we actially have and how much influence over our health care? What if, collectively, we make poor choices? Services that are competing against each other will also be required to work together and integrate. How will that work and who will advise us and regulate all of this?\\n\\n\\t12 December 2011\\n\\n\\t\\u00a0\\n     &#13;\\n  &#13;\\n&#13;\\n&#13;\\n&#13;\\n&#13;\\n&#13;\\n  \\n  \\n    &#13;\\n            \\n\\t\\n\\n\\n\\tAs the world heats up and the effects of climate change become increasingly clear, governments have been given little choice but to introduce policies to reduce carbon emissions. The clean energy sector is to play a key role in this, and as such there has been an increased interest in the companies and technologies that support this industry.\\n\\n\\tProviding access to clean energy also stimulates economic development in less developed nations, offering those who choose to invest in this area with the potential to achieve more than just financial returns. Yet despite this enthusiasm, clean energy funds have not always performed well. Shaken by fluctuations in the stock market, impacted upon by developments in China and the natural gas industry, and affected by changes in government policy and regulation \\u2013 sometimes investors may wonder if just the slightest knock will send this sector tumbling.\\n\\n\\tDoes this mean things can only get better? This financial guide does not pretend to have all the answers. It simply aims to make some sense of clean energy investments for the benefit of our readers.

If so, the coalition may be forced to execute the biggest U-turn of them all.\\n\\n\\t12 September 2011\\n\\n\\t\\u00a0\\n     &#13;\\n  &#13;\\n&#13;\\n&#13;\\n&#13;\\n&#13;\\n&#13;\\n  \\n  \\n    &#13;\\n            \\n\\t\\n\\n\\n\\tThe Education Bill currently making its way through parliament promises to create a system that delivers consistently better standards for all children, with a focus on accountability, discipline and the removal of bureaucracy. School inspectors will be instructed to concentrate on four areas: achievement, teaching, leadership and management, and behaviour and safety. In addition, the Secretary of State will be given powers to intervene in schools that are failing while \\u201cliberating\\u201d outstanding schools and colleges from routine inspection.\\n\\n\\tNotwithstanding the merit or otherwise of the changes the legislation will bring, the implications for head teachers expected to implement it are significant. In such a complex and demanding world, it is not easy to make the best choices.\\n\\n\\tAmong the questions raised are: at what level should education standards be set? What is the best way to reach them? What are the benefits and challenges of collaboration with other schools? What impact will the growing number of academies have on the state system, particularly in a world of increased parental choice? The NS and the National Association of Head Teachers brought together a panel of experts to provide some of the answers.\\n\\n\\t05 September 2011\\n\\n\\t\\u00a0\\n     &#13;\\n  &#13;\\n&#13;\\n&#13;\\n&#13;\\n&#13;\\n&#13;\\n  \\n  \\n    &#13;\\n            \\n\\t\\n\\n\\n\\tFinancial markets are full of fear and fluctuation at the moment. They have been shaken by successive events such as the Greek debt crisis, the US rating downgrade, civil unrest and uncertainty across North Africa and the Middle East, and escalating commodity prices.\\n\\n\\tAll of these derive from beyond our shores and yet private investors in the UK have to decide how to protect their interests against this background. The challenge they face is to preserve their wealth while avoiding its erosion through adverse market movements, inflation, taxation and costs levied by financial services providers.\\n\\n\\tIt is not easy to make the best choices on where to invest, yet to do nothing is to allow inflation to take its toll. This investment strategy supplement aims to offer readers ideas and principles that they can use to guide their thinking. There is no silver bullet, no one-shot solution that will overcome the forces at play. But at least some of the risks can be contained. And choices made now, while markets are in turmoil, may prove fruitful later when they are more stable.\\n\\n\\t22 August 2011\\n\\n\\t\\u00a0\\n     &#13;\\n  &#13;\\n&#13;\\n&#13;\\n&#13;\\n&#13;\\n&#13;\\n  \\n  \\n    &#13;\\n            \\n\\t\\n\\n\\n\\tThe 2050 goal of reducing the UK\\u2019s carbon emissions by 80 per cent compared with 1990 levels is a high priority for the country. While some of us say we agree with these climate change goals, in reality, our behaviour is not compatible with them. For various reasons, we are resistant to nuclear power, to wind farms in our backyards, and to lifestyle changes.\\n\\n\\tHowever, if we don\\u2019t want to see our bills go up, the planet sustain further damage or energy supplies grow insecure, somehow we have to change. Current coalition policy is to let the market decide which pathway provides the best way forwards. But is it really the job of the market to keep the lights on in Britain? What would happen if it chose to sacrifice secure electricity supplies for lower costs? Government does not seem quite sure whether electricity is a commodity or a social service.\\n\\n\\tThe market is in a state of flux; the way that it is financed needs to change. What if the result of this is that targets are not met and we end up with an inadvertent result? Will government hold its nerve or will it step in?\\/p&gt;\\n\\n\\t04 July 2011\\n\\n\\t\\u00a0\\n     &#13;\\n  &#13;\\n&#13;\\n&#13;\\n&#13;\\n&#13;\\n&#13;\\n  \\n  \\n    &#13;\\n            \\n\\t\\n\\n\\n\\tThe energy sector marketplace is an erratic and brutal one. Future energy prices are highly unpredictable, commodity shortages are likely, and no single technology can deliver all of our energy requirements. Our security, what we can afford and our commitment to reducing carbon emissions and tackling climate change require that we have a diverse mix of energy types. This means that those working in the energy marketplace have to make assumptions about future trends and outcomes.\\n\\n\\tSome types of energy are perceived as \\u201cgood\\u201d (usually renewable energy, such as wind power, hydropower and solar power) and others as \\u201cbad\\u201d (usually coal, gas and nuclear energy). While there is no other option but to invest in renewable energy (and the sector is expanding), traditional sources of energy cannot be ignored.\\n\\n\\tThe cost of fossil fuels is still comparatively low and the time when low-carbon options will reach parity is some way off. The question no one can answer is how can we offer the best option for the UK at the lowest price to the taxpayer, especially in such difficult economic times?\\/p&gt;\\n\\n\\t07 March 2011\\n\\n\\t\\u00a0\\n     &#13;\\n  &#13;\\n&#13;\\n&#13;\\n&#13;\\n&#13;\\n&#13;\\n  \\n  \\n    &#13;\\n            \\n\\t\\n\\n\\n\\tIt would be a shame to lose sight of what makes Britain\\u2019s social life so open, creative and appealing. These days there is so much emphasis on the way that digital technologies have entered our lives it is easy to imagine people no longer interact in \\u201creal life\\u201d. But the fact is that we have a rich tradition of socialising which has long been the cradle of our music, our art, and our communities.\\n\\n\\tSometimes we\\u2019re in danger of focusing too much on the negative. And certainly there are negatives to worry about. Which is why it is so vital that regulators and politicians find a way to conserve our precious social heritage while keeping people safe and healthy. The UK\\u2019s music industry has led the world for decades now, but without small venues in which newborn talent can begin to flourish, it may falter.\\n\\n\\tOur society, with its mix of modernity and tradition, as well as its easy diversity, is much admired the world over; we need to better understand and treasure what makes it so rich, before it disappears altogether.\\/p&gt;\\n\\n\\t21 February 2011\\n\\n\\t\\u00a0\\n     &#13;\\n  &#13;\\n&#13;\\n&#13;\\n&#13;\\n&#13;\\n&#13;\\n  \\n  \\n    &#13;\\n            \\n\\t\\n\\n\\n\\tVaccination and immunisation programmes over the past 60 years have transformed public health \\u2013 and not just in the developed world. Modern, advanced research and increased understanding of the sub-cellular processes means that we are already able to foresee a wave of new vaccines that will help prevent complex diseases such as cancers as well as communicable infections.\\n\\n\\tHowever, with any health care issue, priorities, ethics and risks come to the fore. As science takes immunisation to a new level, will public caution and Treasury concerns combine to push new these developments aside?\\n\\n\\tThis supplement aims to explore how immunisation fits with the priorities and architecture of the new NHS under the coalition government and how national public health issues, such as vaccination, will sit within an agenda that is based on choice and local devolution. Both challenges and the opportunities face health care professionals and those concerned about the future of public health and the role that vaccines could have in combating the perils of modern life.\\n\\n\\t24 January 2011\\n\\n\\t\\u00a0\\n     &#13;\\n  &#13;\\n&#13;\\n&#13;\\n&#13;\\n&#13;\\n&#13;\\n  \\n  \\n    &#13;\\n            \\n\\t\\n\\n\\n\\tAfter much delay and anticipation, the government\\u2019s Open Public Services white paper, published in July 2011, sets out how it intends to improve and modernise our public services. By \\u201cputting choice and control in the hands of individuals and neighbourhoods\\u201d, it believes it can make public services more responsive to people\\u2019s needs. It is applying five key principles: increased choice; decentralising power to the \\u201clowest appropriate level\\u201d; diversity \\u2013 public services should be open to a range of providers; fair access to services; accountability \\u2013 our public services should be accountable to service users and taxpayers. .\\n\\n\\tIt all sounds like something we might be able to sign up to. However, choice requires that people are informed in a way that they understand and can use to bring about positive benefits for themselves. Choice needs to be genuine rather than simply a variety of providers offering the same services. And if we are having diversity, will all choices be available to all people in all areas? Will people be able to buy in services from their neighbouring local authority if what they want isn\\u2019t offered in their area?\\n\\n\\tCharities will be given more opportunities to bid for government money. Trustees and charity managers will have to make some careful decisions. However, are charities ready to deliver the types of public services that government wants and the public needs? While many are already having success, others will not have the skills, experience or capital to do the job at the scale that is being asked of them.\\n\\n\\t09 January 2012\\n\\n\\t\\u00a0\\n     &#13;\\n  &#13;\\n&#13;\\n&#13;\\n&#13;\\n&#13;\\n&#13;\\n  \\n  \\n    &#13;\\n            \\n\\t\\n\\n\\n\\tThe UK pharmaceutical industry is a major part of the life sciences sector. It employs over 72,000 people, invests considerably in research and development, and contributes \\u00a37bn a year to the economy. It also has access to a strong academic base that offers extensive expertise in translational medicine and database studies, while the NHS offers data and research opportunities unmatched anywhere else in the world thanks to its national database of patient records.\\n\\n\\tWith so many benefits and opportunities, it would appear that little can hinder the UK\\u2019s position as a world leader in this field. However, globally the life sciences industry is changing. The financial crisis has hindered funding opportunities \\u2013 just as it has in other sectors, and investments and workforces are being consolidated. At the same time, the market place is becoming increasingly competitive.\\n\\n\\tWhat impact is this likely to have on the UK pharmaceutical and life sciences sectors? What is needed to ensure a position of leadership and that they remain attractive to investors, companies and academia? To address all these questions and more, New Statesman, in partnership with Pfizer, has brought some of the leading voices together.\\n\\n\\t16 January 2012\\n\\n\\t\\u00a0\\n     &#13;\\n  &#13;\\n&#13;\\n&#13;\\n&#13;\\n&#13;\\n&#13;\\n  \\n  \\n    &#13;\\n            \\n\\t\\n\\n\\n\\tThe government attempts to prevent anti-competitive practices \\u2013 operations that are against the public interest. Competition policy is one of the pillars of the internal market and competition law and regulation should protect competition by controlling the operation of firms that may have monopoly power in their own industry, as this may lead to consumers being exploited. Markets work best when there is a healthy rivalry between companies and they compete to serve active and informed customers who want and are able to reward good performers and withhold reward from those who don\\u2019t measure up. .\\n\\n\\tLaw should make monopoly and oligopoly impossible, and should encourage new market entry, wider choice, lower prices and higher quality. Regulation is designed to deal with the problem of market failure \\u2013 where markets fail to reach an optimal allocation of resources. However, as Phillip Blond points out, many interventions by regulators have had perverse consequences, including market concentration, with a shrinking number of competitors, further increasing the possibility of a monopolist or semi-monopolist control of the market. This means that the market becomes further and further removed from free and genuine competition.\\n\\n\\tHow can we create the competition policy and regulation \\u2013 with a proper accountability structure \\u2013 that the UK needs for growth, innovation and the widening of ownership and prosperity? With UK communications regulation under the spotlight in 2012, there is a chance to review the entire media regulation framework.\\n\\n\\t30 January 2012\\n\\n\\t\\u00a0\\n     &#13;\\n  &#13;\\n&#13;\\n&#13;\\n&#13;\\n&#13;\\n&#13;\\n  \\n  \\n    &#13;\\n            \\n\\t\\n\\n\\tOn the one hand, union leaders have not got an easy life at present.

Last month, a bill was presented to parliament that aims to resolve the issue once and for all.\\n\\n\\tAt its heart is the requirement that 80 per cent of House of Lords members are to be elected by the British public for a non-renewable 15-year term. Gone will be the life peers, and in their place a system that enables members to resign, to be expelled and to be suspended. No longer will members be able to claim \\u00a3300 a day simply for turning up; instead pay will be related to their level of input into parliamentary business.\\n\\n\\tOpponents to the bill claim there is no public appetite for it; that it is a waste of parliamentary time; that an elected Lords would challenge the authority of the House of Commons. Yet these voices have failed to acknowledge one crucial factor \\u2013 that an unelected second chamber has no place in a country that prides itself on its democratic principles.\\n\\n\\t16 July 2012\\n\\n\\tDownload the PDF here\\n     &#13;\\n  &#13;\\n&#13;\\n&#13;\\n&#13;\\n&#13;\\n&#13;\\n  \\n  \\n    &#13;\\n            \\n\\t\\n\\n\\tPlans to \\u201crestore rigour in the key primary subjects\\u201d were set out by Education Secretary Michael Gove recently in his new draft overhaul of the Primary National Curriculum.\\n\\n\\tThe plans propose a back-to-basics curriculum, focusing on times-tables, spelling and grammar. Pupils will be expected to have learned their times-tables up to 12 by the age of nine, to multiply and divide fractions by the age of 11 and to start learning and reciting poetry from five years old. The coalition Government has made much of giving schools more autonomy in how and what they teach. Some have welcomed the renewed focus on the traditional \\u201cthree Rs\\u201d as good preparation for secondary school. However, some union leaders fear that this heavily prescribed curriculum will leave little room for teachers to adapt learning to their individual pupils\\u2019 needs and to make lessons exciting for them.\\n\\n\\tThis supplement looks at how far a very traditional approach can be reconciled with what we now know about the benefits of a creative education, which promotes the ability to question, make connections, innovate, problem-solve, communicate, collaborate and to reflect critically.

Its roots can be traced to religious rituals in primitive pre-historic societies. From these rituals, gambling grew into a separate activity used to make decisions about who would get a bigger piece of prey or a woman. Eventually pure gambling for material gain evolved.\\n\\n\\tThe Victorians found gambling deeply immoral and irreligious. In 1906 the Street Betting Act was passed,making street betting illegal. The only legal betting was that done at the race track. This suddenly put legal gambling as a leisure pursuit out of reach for a generation of working men who had neither the time nor the money to attend the races.\\n\\n\\tAs the 20th century progressed, the government moulded legislation to limit and control gambling opportunitieswhile drawing revenue from them. Todaygambling is global, yet the tension between regulators and the owners of gambling businesses still exists. With jobs and businesses at stake, now more than ever before the industry is fighting for what it regards as a fair deal from government\\n\\n\\t25 April 2012\\n\\n\\t\\u00a0\\n     &#13;\\n  &#13;\\n&#13;\\n&#13;\\n&#13;\\n&#13;\\n&#13;\\n  \\n  \\n    &#13;\\n            \\n\\t\\n\\n\\n\\tDoctors have always tried to make as accurate a diagnosis as possible for every patient, taking into account their family history, their age and so on. In the past, when prescribing a drug or treatment, they have also taken into account any other illnesses the patient might have, and any likely side effects.\\n\\n\\tBut, recently, this \\u201cpersonalisation\\u201d of medicine has changed gear. Advances in technology now mean that doctors are increasingly able to make a more complex and deeper diagnosis and prescribe different drugs, because they can get detailed information about each patient\\u2019s individual genetic make up. They also have a better understanding of molecular factors of diseases.\\n\\n\\tThe old ways of working need to change if we are to be able to share the benefits of these advances equally. New drugs are being carefully regulated but what about new methods of diagnosis? Should our existing drugs and diagnostics not be subjected to the same new rigour? These are just some of the questions that are considered by experts in the field who share their experiences in this supplement.\\n\\n\\t26 March 2012\\n\\n\\t\\u00a0\\n     &#13;\\n  &#13;\\n&#13;\\n&#13;\\n&#13;\\n&#13;\\n&#13;\\n  \\n  \\n    &#13;\\n            \\n\\t\\n\\n\\n\\tBack in the day, saving used to be common place with much of the population keeping behind a proportion of their wages for a rainy day. That was until the mid 1990s when a combination of low unemployment, falling interest rates and markets awash with credit provided more of an incentive to borrow than save. Building a nest egg, whether to pay for a deposit on a house or to see you through your retirement, suddenly wasn\\u2019t as popular. .\\n\\n\\tToday\\u2019s government is keen to reverse that trend \\u2013which is perhaps not surprising given we\\u2019re a nation saddled with debt and a massive pension problem. It is keen to turn us back into a population of savers, for whom setting income aside is second nature.\\n\\n\\tOne financial product that could help set us on our way is the Individual Savings Account \\u2013 or ISA as they are more commonly known. Tax-efficient and with a range of options available to meet a variety of needs, ISAs have potential both as a temporary and long-term savings vehicle. But they also have their short comings. To help shed a little light on the issue, New Statesman, in partnership with Governor, have produced this handy guide.\\n\\n\\t19 March 2012\\n\\n\\t\\u00a0\\n     &#13;\\n  &#13;\\n&#13;\\n&#13;\\n&#13;\\n&#13;\\n&#13;\\n  \\n  \\n    &#13;\\n            \\n\\t\\n\\n\\n\\tIs the government committed to tackling poverty in the UK?

Supported by the Webb Memorial Trust, New Statesman explores what has changed since 1909 when Beatrice and Sidney Webb conducted their seminal research into the causes of poverty and what, if anything, can we learn from the past? What role can the labour market play?

But Halliburton does say it expects the oil sector to remain \\\"challenged.\\\"   SunTrust   (NYSE: STI)-The bank earned 78 cents per share for its latest quarter, 6 cents above estimates, with revenue essentially in line.

It cited a lack of negative catalysts, and potential benefit in a variety of breakup scenarios.    Splunk   (NASDAQ: SPLK)-Citi began coverage of the cyber security firm's stock with a rating of \\\"buy\\/high risk.\\\" Citi said Splunk may benefit from a rapidly expanding market, but pointed out that the stock has been volatile as Splunk changed its pricing structure multiple times.   Michael Kors   (NYSE: KORS)-Mizuho downgraded the luxury goods maker to \\\"neutral\\\" from \\\"buy,\\\" following the results of a proprietary survey that the firm said does not necessarily bode well for future sales.

such as CISSP, GIAC, and IRAP - but would be specific to the Australian environment and its skills requirements, AISA said.\\n\\u201cThe program will include skills confirmation and continuing professional development requirements, which will be managed by AISA,\\u201d the organisation wrote.\\n\\u201cTo support this scheme, AISA proposes to provide ongoing education and professional development opportunities to its members in cooperation with organisations such as AusCERT.\\n\\\"AISA will also engage with both the public and private sectors to encourage and explain the long term benefits of supporting this program.\\u201d\\nSecurity skills shortage\\nAISA echoed concerns raised by the Comms Alliance around a skills gap in the local infosec industry and the increasing amount of skilled infosec specialists leaving Australia.\\nThe Comms Alliance highlighted a lack of skills in areas including forensics, pen testing, incident management and risk assessment, and urged the Government to include a targeted program to retain and develop such expertise within its revised cyber security strategy.\\nAISA similarly listed pen testing, forensics, security architects and application security testers among the skills currently in short supply across Australia.\\nIt said this shortage could be addressed by reviewing tertiary education and vocational training offerings as well as sponsoring employment of graduates leaving university with such skills.\\nGreater investment in research and development of products and services in Australia - rather than relying on overseas companies - would encourage the retention and growth of in-demand skills locally.\\n\\u201cProfessional networks are imperative. The industry, and our adversaries, all move too fast for us to try to capture all approaches to each risk and\\/or threat in a core body of knowledge which is formally taught in detail over a set period of time,\\u201d AISA wrote.\\n\\u201cUltimately, what will be most important is a strong grounding in a particular discipline (e.g. like computer science, or engineering), training in high level frameworks and principles, communications skills, and an individual\\u2019s professional network.\\u201d\\nThe Department of Prime Minister and Cabinet - the agency leading the review - said it had so far consulted with over 140 organisations globally. It expects to complete and release the revised review midway through this year.\\n\\u00a0Copyright  \\u00a9 iTnews.com.au .

Ten thousand of these hires would be from Israel in the cyber security domain, for which it would be tapping the Israeli government, Pillai said. Another 10,000 hires are going to be in Mexico, and the last 10,000 would be made from among the ranks of India's differently abled, he said.UST Global, which is targeting a topline of $3 billion in the next two years, claims to be the fastest organically growing company in Indian IT. Pillai said a new campus with a built-up area of three million square feet is coming up in Thiruvananthapuram at a cost of $200 million. Apart from Thiruvananthapuram, the company is present in six Indian cities, he said.Pillai said the company's early bets on retail and healthcare has paid off with most of the growth in IT in the past three years coming from these verticals. In his view, this will remain so for the next five to ten years. Pillai said the company has identified that the six basic services of design, cyber security (in partnership with Israeli spy agency Mossad), analytics, cloud, mobility, and social are going to decide the intersection of technology and business, and would be focusing on them.UST Global Chief Administrative Officer Alexander Varghese announced the signing of a seven-year, $38-million engagement with the Madhya Pradesh government on digitisation and automation of urban local bodies. The programme, which is an end-to-end eGovernance engagement, will touch 377 local bodies, he said.Pillai further said the company has launched a venture capital (VC) fund based in Bengaluru, for which the initial investments will be the tune of $20 million. He said the VC fund will tap into the learnings from the company's similar initiatives in Palo Alto and Israel. Among the interesting work done by the company, it is rolling out a software product to apply analytics to cricket, for which the tie-up with Chennai Super Kings &amp;mdash; with UST Global as the principal sponsor &amp;mdash; will come in handy, he said.

Demand for cybersecurity technology has increased after a spate of high-profile breaches at companies such as Sony Corp  and Target Corp.  Austin, Texas-based Websense helps to protect companies from such attacks and data theft. More than 11,000 enterprises rely on its TRITON security offerings, according to its website. Vista took Websense private two years ago for $990 million.  The new company, which will be headed by Websense CEO John McCormack, will be a separately reported business unit, Raytheon said.  A board of directors will be formed for the new company and will include representatives of both Raytheon and Vista Equity Partners, the company said.

(NYSE:NSR), \\n      a trusted, neutral provider of real-time information services and \\n      analytics, today announced findings from its 2015 \\n      North America Denial of Service (DDoS) Attacks &amp; Impact Report. \\n      The findings highlight an increase in the number and size of DDoS \\n      attacks, their costly and devastating effects on brand perception, and a \\n      heightened state of preparedness for North American businesses.\\n    \\n      Key survey findings:\\n    \\n      \\n        91 percent say DDoS attacks are a bigger or same threat as last year\\n      \\n      \\n        85 percent of companies are attacked multiple times\\n      \\n      \\n        32 percent of companies would lose more than $100k in revenue per hour \\n        of attack\\n      \\n      \\n        26 percent report DDoS attacks adversely affect customer trust and \\n        brand reputation\\n      \\n      \\n        31 percent say their longest attacks last more than one day\\n      \\n    \\n      \\u201cWith 51 percent of companies investing more of their annual budget to \\n      prevent DDoS attacks, this study proves that DDoS has transcended to an \\n      institutional threat that is very real and recognized by all members of \\n      the C-suite,\\u201d said Margee Abrams, CISSP, director of security services \\n      at Neustar. \\u201cA website attack that was once considered to be an IT \\n      problem now reverberates and can cause significant brand damage that \\n      affects all organizational employees and its customers.\\u201d\\n    \\n      As a response to the pervasive DDoS attacks, companies have increased \\n      their adoption of Hybrid protection by 55 percent from last year.\\n    \\n      Hybrid, a highly recommended approach that allows companies to mitigate \\n      DDoS attacks by combining on-site hardware and cloud-based solutions, is \\n      also the defense of choice by 94 percent of companies who would lose \\n      more than $100k per hour during peak business times.\\n    \\n\\n\\n\\n\\n      \\u201cThe increased hybrid adoption reflects the growing need for companies \\n      to have immediate, on premise DDoS defense capabilities, in addition to \\n      surge defense capabilities in response to larger attacks,\\u201d said Abrams. \\n      \\u201cCompanies continue to rely on layered traditional perimeter defenses \\n      including firewalls, routers and switches as well as DDoS mitigation \\n      services. But when revenues and brand reputation are at risk, deploying \\n      a hybrid solution offers the best of both worlds: immediate on premise \\n      protection with the capacity that only cloud providers can offer.\\u201d she \\n      added.\\n    \\n      To conduct the study, Neustar surveyed 510 companies across a diverse \\n      range of industries including financial services, technology, retail, \\n      government &amp; public sector, health care, energy &amp; utility, \\n      telecommunications, e-commerce, Internet services and media.\\n    \\n      Joe Loveless, security solutions expert at Neustar, will present the \\n      report findings today at the 2015 West Coast Information Security and \\n      Broader Technology Growth Conference in San Francisco.

Denial of Service (DoS), SQL injections and cross-site scripting are the most common web attack vectors, increasing in popularity. As migration to the cloud continues and expands, companies today are facing a more distributed network infrastructure. This transition of web based applications to the cloud have rendered on-premise mitigation tools ineffective against web attacks and require organizations to protect their applications both on-premise and in-the-cloud.Radware's new Hybrid Cloud WAF Service is an industry first that provides a fully managed enterprise grade WAF that protects both on-premise and cloud-based applications, using a single technology solution. Unlike existing WAF solutions that integrate dual technologies which results in a gap between protection coverage and quality, Radware's single technology approach makes migrating applications to the cloud safer and secure.\\\"It's not uncommon for enterprises to distribute their applications both on-premise and in-the-cloud. In addition, we see enterprises employ multiple cloud vendors to host various aspects of their infrastructure. However, having a disparate network infrastructure adds a level of complexity when trying to protect your web applications,\\\" says Carl Herberger, vice president of security solutions for Radware. \\\"We have taken actionable steps to provide enterprise with a unified hybrid solution against web-based attacks regardless if protection is needed on-premise or in the cloud and provide better security when moving applications to the cloud as well as ease of security policy orchestration and automation.\\\"In addition to protection from various web attacks, Radware's Hybrid Cloud WAF can also defend and mitigate a wide range of DDoS attacks through its always-on DDoS attack protection, and provide comprehensive detection and mitigation of attacks with minimal false positives and no impact on legitimate traffic.\\\"When there is no technical integration between on-premise and cloud WAF technologies, organizations are faced with poor quality of detection resulting in poor mitigation options,\\\" says Jon Oltsik, senior principal analyst, Enterprise Strategy Group. \\\"Radware's Hybrid Cloud WAF Service can help bridge this gap by integrating its on-premise devices and WAF technologies with cloud-based coverage to deliver a comprehensive detection and mitigation solution.\\\"The Hybrid Cloud WAF Service also provides full coverage from all of OWASP's Top 10 security risks and is backed by Radware's Emergency Response Team \\u2013 a dedicated group of security experts that can actively monitor and mitigate attacks in real time.For additional information on Radware's Hybrid Cloud WAF service, please visit http:\\/\\/www.radware.com\\/hybridcloudwaf or visit Radware at booth S2021 during this year's RSA Conference in San Francisco, CA.About RadwareRadware (Nasdaq:RDWR), is a global leader of application delivery and application security solutions for virtual, cloud and software defined data centers.

Humphries II claimed under oath that he \\\"was told by supervisors that\\\" the 2012 presidential election \\\"would explain the potential reason why there was so much interference\\\" in the case \\\"from headquarters, that nobody wanted this case during an election cycle.\\\"The deposition is part of the lawsuit brought by Dr. Scott and Jill Kelley against government agencies, departments and major figures in the Obama administration for allegedly defaming their character in the Petraeus-Broadwell sex scandal. The affair between Petraeus and Broadwell, his biographer-turned lover, brought a disgraced end to the decorated general's career.Though the Kelleys were the victims of the original cyberstalking case, as the Petraeus scandal exploded in the public, many in the media painted Jill Kelley in a particularly unflattering light.Petraeus pleaded guilty last month to one federal charge of removing and retaining classified information, having improperly shared his black books with Broadwell and lied about it to the FBI. He is scheduled to be sentenced on Thursday. All charges against Broadwell were dropped in December 2012.Humphries testified he believed Kelley's name had been leaked by someone at FBI headquarters \\\"and it seemed to be a purposeful attempt to discredit both Mrs. Kelley and myself.\\\"Humphries said in his deposition he was confused by FBI's leaders' focus on Jill Kelley instead of Broadwell, whom they identified as the cyberstalker as early as June 2012. He testified her actions compromised security of high-level military intelligence personnel and information, but for some reason higher-ups in the FBI kept interfering in what seemed to him to be a fairly straightforward case. In one incident, FBI agents were called back from the airport as they were about to fly to North Carolina to interview Broadwell.All the while, the FBI kept shifting focus on the victims in the case, Humphries testified, or more specifically on Jill Kelley. He wondered if this warped view of the case was rooted in \\\"ineptness, incompetence or was politically motivated,\\\" he testified.Law enforcement officials told CNN what Humphries and others regarded as interference from headquarters could also be seen as efforts to ensure the FBI did everything by the book in a highly sensitive case. (They got court-approved warrants for things normally the FBI can administratively subpoena). Some at the FBI thought Humphries did things to keep inserting himself into the case even after he was told to recuse himself given that he had a friendly relationship with Kelley. Those efforts allegedly include attempts at communication that Humphries is said to have had during the course of the investigations with then-House Majority Leader Eric Cantor, R-Virginia.He testified that he and his wife and children are friends with the Kelleys and their children through their outreach to the military and law enforcement communities in Tampa, and did not understand his bosses' insinuations or harsh judgments.A request for comment made by CNN to a representative of Paula Broadwell was not met by press time.Alan Raul, an attorney for the Kelleys, also declined comment to CNN on Sunday, as did Petraeus attorney Robert Barnett. A spokesman for the Justice Department did not return a call from CNN on Sunday; a spokesman for the FBI did not offer any comment. The administration has refrained from commenting on the case in the past given the current litigation.FBI blaming the victims?The story began in May 2012, when four-star Gen. John Allen began receiving emails from \\\"kelleypatrol@gmail.com,\\\" which \\\"disparaged\\\" Kelley and referenced an upcoming private dinner the Kelleys were hosting with \\\"several senior foreign intelligence, defense and diplomatic officials,\\\" according to the lawsuit. The email troubled Allen given the potential security concern and \\\"frightened the Kelleys, as it indicated that Mrs. Kelley was being followed or stalked, and raised serious concerns about her own safety and well being, particularly given the number of terrorist risks faced by CENTCOM leaders.\\\"Broadwell later admitted to having sent that email as well as another from \\\"Tampa Angel\\\" to Dr. Scott Kelley, also disparaging his wife, promising \\\"embarrassment for all, including spouses, such as info in national headlines.\\\"Jill Kelley reached out to Humphries, an FBI Agent whom she and her husband knew socially. \\\"She explained that Gen. Allen had received an odd email,\\\" Humphries testified, noting that \\\"whoever sent these emails is either in close physical proximity or has penetrated the cyber security of these folks to include the director of the Central Intelligence Agency, Director Petraeus, and I was worried and concerned for his safety, the safety of the generals.\\\"Humphries thought the emails \\\"ominous\\\" and contacted Special Agent Adam Malone of the Tampa Cyber Squad. \\\"We had already reached the threshold on the cyber or physical security of senior government leadership and possible their email,\\\" he said.By the third week of June, the FBI had identified Broadwell as the cyberstalker, Humphries said, relating how he saw FBI videotape of \\\"a BMW pulling up to a Starbucks in North Carolina and shortly thereafter the alleged subject of the case enters and logs on, and some of the emails were being sent, so they had a firm idea of who it was.\\\"\\n\\n            \",\n                \"source\": \"www.wcyb.com\",\n                \"publishDate\": \"2015-04-20T10:01:11+02:00\",\n                \"sourceType\": \"web\",\n                \"language\": \"en\",\n                \"googleRank\": 5,\n                \"relatedDocs\": [\n\n                ]\n            },\n            {\n                \"id\": 186700771,\n                \"url\": \"http:\\/\\/www.msn.com\\/en-ph\\/news\\/world\\/new-zealand-pm-happy-to-talk-to-china-about-spy-claims\\/ar-AAbl0x3?srcref=rss\",\n                \"title\": \"\\n New Zealand Prime Minister John Key on Monday invited Chinese officials to quiz him about reports that Wellington worked with US intelligence on a plan to hack Chinese diplomatic communications.\\n \\n\\n\",\n                \"content\": \"\\n New Zealand Prime Minister John Key on Monday invited Chinese officials to quiz him about reports that Wellington worked with US intelligence on a plan to hack Chinese diplomatic communications.\\n \\n\\n \\n  \\n     &#13;\\n        &#13;\\n    &#13;\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n \\u00a9 AFP\\/File\\n New Zealand's Prime Minister John Key, pictured during a press conference in Wellington, on November 20, 2014\\n\\n\\nBeijing has reportedly expressed concern at the claims, which are based on documents from US whistleblower Edward Snowden obtained by Auckland's Herald on Sunday newspaper.The newspaper reported that New Zealand intelligence and the US National Security Agency collaborated on a plan to hack a data link between China's consulate in Auckland and a nearby visa office run by the Chinese.It said it was unclear whether the hack went ahead because Snowden fled the NSA in May 2013, before it had come to fruition.State news agency Xinhua said the Chinese embassy in Wellington issued a statement saying it was concerned about the report and attached great importance to cyber security.\\\"We will firmly safeguard our security interests and continue to guarantee our cyber and information security with concrete measures,\\\" it said.\\\"At present, cyber space is riddled with chaos and uncertainty.

Sebelius\\nBurwell v. Hobby Lobby\\nKing v. Burwell\\n\\n\\nThe Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act (PPACA), commonly called the Affordable Care Act (ACA) or \\\"ObamaCare\\\", is a United States federal statute signed into law by President Barack Obama on March 23, 2010. Together with the Health Care and Education Reconciliation Act amendment, it represents the most significant regulatory overhaul of the U.S. healthcare system since the passage of Medicare and Medicaid in 1965.\\nThe ACA was enacted to increase the quality and affordability of health insurance, lower the uninsured rate by expanding public and private insurance coverage, and reduce the costs of healthcare for individuals and the government. It introduced mechanisms like mandates, subsidies, and insurance exchanges.[1][2] The law requires insurance companies to cover all applicants within new minimum standards and offer the same rates regardless of pre-existing conditions or sex.[3] Additional reforms were increased competition, regulation, and incentives to streamline the delivery of healthcare. In 2011 the Congressional Budget Office projected that the ACA would lower both future deficits[4] and Medicare spending.[5]\\nOn June 28, 2012, the United States Supreme Court upheld the constitutionality of the ACA's individual mandate as an exercise of Congress's taxing power[6] in the case National Federation of Independent Business v. Sebelius. However, the Court held that states cannot be forced to participate in the ACA's Medicaid expansion under penalty of losing their current Medicaid funding.[7][8][9] Since the ruling, the law and its implementation have continued to face challenges in Congress and federal courts, and from some state governments, conservative advocacy groups, labor unions, and small business organizations.\\nAs of mid-2015, an additional 11 million Americans gained health insurance coverage under the ACA, and the percentage of uninsured Americans dropped from 18% in 2013 to 11.9%.[10][11]\\n\\n\\n\\nOverview of provisions\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nThe President and White House Staff react to the House of Representatives passing the bill on March 21, 2010.\\n\\n\\nThe Affordable Care Act (ACA)[12][13] or Obamacare,[14] includes numerous provisions that took effect between 2010 and 2020. Policies issued before 2010 are exempted by a grandfather clause from many of the changes to insurance standards, but they were affected by other provisions.[15][16] Significant reforms, most of which took effect on January 1, 2014, include:\\n\\nGuaranteed issue prohibits insurers from denying coverage to individuals due to pre-existing conditions, and a partial community rating requires insurers to offer the same premium price to all applicants of the same age and geographical location without regard to gender or most pre-existing conditions (excluding tobacco use).[17][18][19]\\nMinimum standards for health insurance policies are established.[20][21][22][23][24]\\nAn individual mandate[25][26] requires all individuals not covered by an employer sponsored health plan, Medicaid, Medicare or other public insurance programs (such as Tricare) to secure an approved private-insurance policy or pay a penalty, unless the applicable individual has a financial hardship or is a member of a recognized religious sect exempted by the Internal Revenue Service.[27] The law includes subsidies to help people with low incomes comply with the mandate.[28]\\nHealth insurance exchanges operate as a new avenue by which individuals and small businesses in every state can compare policies and buy insurance (with a government subsidy if eligible).[29] In the first year of operation, open enrollment on the exchanges ran from October 1, 2013 to March 31, 2014. The original purchase deadline date to be covered for January 1, 2014 was December 15, 2013, but the deadline was pushed back, first to December 23, 2013 and later to December 24, 2013.[30][31][32][33] For plans starting in 2015, the proposed enrollment period is November 15, 2014 \\u2013 February 15, 2015.[34]\\nLow-income individuals and families whose incomes are between 100% and 400% of the federal poverty level will receive federal subsidies on a sliding scale if they purchase insurance via an exchange.[35] Those from 133% to 150% of the poverty level will be subsidized such that their premium costs will be 3% to 4% of income.[36] In 2013, the subsidy would apply for incomes up to $45,960 for an individual or $94,200 for a family of four; consumers can choose to receive their tax credits in advance, and the exchange will send the money directly to the insurer every month.[37] Small businesses will be eligible for subsidies.[38]\\nMedicaid eligibility expanded to include individuals and families with incomes up to 133% of the federal poverty level, including adults without disabilities and without dependent children.[39] The law also provides for a 5% \\\"income disregard\\\", making the effective income eligibility limit for Medicaid 138% of the poverty level.[40] Furthermore, the State Children's Health Insurance Program (CHIP) enrollment process is simplified.[39] However, in National Federation of Independent Business v. Sebelius, the Supreme Court ruled that states may opt out of the Medicaid expansion, and several have done so.\\nReforms to the Medicare payment system are meant to promote greater efficiency in the healthcare delivery system by restructuring Medicare reimbursements from fee-for-service to bundled payments.[41][42] Under the new payment system, a single payment is paid to a hospital and a physician group for a defined episode of care (such as a hip replacement) rather than individual payments to individual service providers. In addition, the Medicare Part D coverage gap (commonly called the \\\"donut hole\\\") will shrink incrementally, closing completely by January 1, 2020.[43]\\nBusinesses which employ 50 or more people but do not offer health insurance to their full-time employees will pay a tax penalty if the government has subsidized a full-time employee's healthcare through tax deductions or other means. This is commonly known as the employer mandate.[44][45] In July 2013, the Internal Revenue Service delayed enforcement of this provision for one year.[46]\\n\\nLegislative history\\nBackground\\n\\nThe Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act consists of a combination of measures to control healthcare costs, and an expansion of coverage through public and private insurance: broader Medicaid eligibility and Medicare coverage, and subsidized, regulated private insurance. An individual mandate coupled with subsidies for private insurance as a means for universal healthcare was considered the best way to win the support of the Senate because it had been included in prior bipartisan reform proposals. The concept goes back to at least 1989, when the conservative Heritage Foundation proposed an individual mandate as an alternative to single-payer health care.[47] It was championed for a time by conservative economists and Republican senators as a market-based approach to healthcare reform on the basis of individual responsibility and avoidance of free rider problems. Specifically, because the 1986 Emergency Medical Treatment and Active Labor Act (EMTALA) requires any hospital participating in Medicare (which nearly all do) to provide emergency care to anyone who needs it, the government often indirectly bore the cost of those without the ability to pay.[48][49][50]\\nWhen President Bill Clinton proposed a healthcare reform bill in 1993 that included a mandate for employers to provide health insurance to all employees through a regulated marketplace of health maintenance organizations, Republican Senators proposed an alternative that would have required individuals, but not employers, to buy insurance.[49] Ultimately the Clinton plan failed amid an unprecedented barrage of negative advertising funded by politically conservative groups and the health insurance industry and due to concerns that it was overly complex.[51] After failing to obtain a comprehensive reform of the healthcare system, Clinton negotiated a compromise with the 105th Congress to instead enact the State Children's Health Insurance Program (SCHIP) in 1997.[52]\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nThe 1993 Republican alternative, introduced by Senator John Chafee as the Health Equity and Access Reform Today Act, contained a \\\"universal coverage\\\" requirement with a penalty for noncompliance\\u2014an individual mandate\\u2014as well as subsidies to be used in state-based 'purchasing groups'.[53] Advocates for the 1993 bill included prominent Republicans who today oppose a mandate, such as Senators Orrin Hatch, Chuck Grassley, Bob Bennett, and Kit Bond.[54][55] Of the 43 Republicans Senators from 1993, 20 supported the HEART Act.[47][56] Another Republican proposal, introduced in 1994 by Senator Don Nickles (R-OK), the Consumer Choice Health Security Act, contained an individual mandate with a penalty provision;[57] however, Nickles subsequently removed the mandate from the bill, stating he had decided \\\"that government should not compel people to buy health insurance\\\".[58] At the time of these proposals, Republicans did not raise constitutional issues with the mandate; Mark Pauly, who helped develop a proposal that included an individual mandate for George H.W. Bush, remarked, \\\"I don\\u2019t remember that being raised at all. The way it was viewed by the Congressional Budget Office in 1994 was, effectively, as a tax.\\\"[47]\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nMitt Romney's Massachusetts went from 90% of its residents insured to 98%, the highest rate in the nation.[59]\\n\\n\\nIn 2006, an insurance expansion bill was enacted at the state level in Massachusetts. The bill contained both an individual health insurance mandate and an insurance exchange. Republican Governor Mitt Romney vetoed the mandate, but after Democrats overrode his veto, he signed it into law.[60] Romney's implementation of the 'Health Connector' exchange and individual mandate in Massachusetts was at first lauded by Republicans. During Romney's 2008 presidential campaign, Senator Jim DeMint praised Romney's ability to \\\"take some good conservative ideas, like private health insurance, and apply them to the need to have everyone insured.\\\" Romney said of the individual mandate: \\\"I'm proud of what we've done. If Massachusetts succeeds in implementing it, then that will be the model for the nation.\\\"[61]\\nIn 2007, a year after the Massachusetts reform, Republican Senator Bob Bennett and Democratic Senator Ron Wyden introduced the Healthy Americans Act, which also featured an individual mandate and state-based regulated insurance markets called \\\"State Health Help Agencies\\\".[50][61] The bill initially attracted bipartisan support but died in committee. Many of the sponsors and co-sponsors remained in Congress during the 2008 healthcare debate.[62]\\nBy 2008 many Democrats were considering using this approach as the basis for healthcare reform. Experts have said that the legislation that eventually emerged from Congress in 2009 and 2010 bears many similarities to the 2007 bill[53] and that it was deliberately patterned after Romney's state healthcare plan.[63] Jonathan Gruber, a professor of economics at MIT and an architect of Massachusetts' health care reform who advised the Clinton and Obama presidential campaigns on healthcare issues, served as a technical consultant to the Obama administration, and helped draft the ACA.[64]\\nHealthcare debate, 2008\\u201310\\n\\nHealthcare reform was a major topic of discussion during the 2008 Democratic presidential primaries. As the race narrowed, attention focused on the plans presented by the two leading candidates, Hillary Clinton and the eventual nominee, Barack Obama. Each candidate proposed a plan to cover the approximately 45\\u00a0million Americans estimated to not have health insurance at some point each year. Clinton's plan would have required all Americans to obtain coverage (in effect, an individual mandate), while Obama's provided a subsidy but rejected the use of an individual mandate.[65][66] During the general election, Obama said that fixing healthcare would be one of his top four priorities if he won the presidency.[67]\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nAfter his inauguration, Obama announced to a joint session of Congress in February 2009 his intent to work with Congress to construct a plan for healthcare reform.[68][69] By July, a series of bills were approved by committees within the House of Representatives.[70] On the Senate side, from June to September, the Senate Finance Committee held a series of 31 meetings to develop a healthcare reform bill. This group \\u2014 in particular, Democrats Max Baucus, Jeff Bingaman, and Kent Conrad, and Republicans Mike Enzi, Chuck Grassley, and Olympia Snowe \\u2014 met for more than 60 hours, and the principles that they discussed, in conjunction with the other committees, became the foundation of the Senate's healthcare reform bill.[71][72][73]\\nWith universal healthcare as one of the stated goals of the Obama administration, congressional Democrats and health policy experts like Jonathan Gruber and David Cutler argued that guaranteed issue would require both community rating and an individual mandate to ensure that adverse selection and\\/or \\\"free riding\\\" would not result in an insurance \\\"death spiral\\\";[74] they convinced Obama that this was necessary, and persuaded him to accept congressional proposals that included a mandate.[75] This approach was taken because the president and congressional leaders had concluded that more progressive plans, such as the (single-payer) Medicare for All act, could not obtain filibuster-proof support in the Senate. By deliberately drawing on bipartisan ideas \\u2014 the same basic outline was supported by former Senate majority leaders Howard Baker, Bob Dole, Tom Daschle and George J. Mitchell\\u2014the bill's drafters hoped to increase the chances of garnering the necessary votes for passage.[76][77]\\nHowever, following the adoption of an individual mandate as a central component of the proposed reforms by Democrats, Republicans began to oppose the mandate and threatened to filibuster any bills that contained it.[47] Senate minority leader Mitch McConnell, who led the Republican congressional strategy in responding to the bill, calculated that Republicans should not support the bill, and worked to keep party discipline and prevent defections:[78]\\n\\nIt was absolutely critical that everybody be together because if the proponents of the bill were able to say it was bipartisan, it tended to convey to the public that this is O.K., they must have figured it out.[79]\\n\\nRepublican Senators, including those who had supported previous bills with a similar mandate, began to describe the mandate as \\\"unconstitutional.\\\" Journalist Ezra Klein wrote in The New Yorker that \\\"the end result was ... a policy that once enjoyed broad support within the Republican Party suddenly faced unified opposition.\\\"[50] Reporter Michael Cooper of The New York Times wrote that: \\\"It can be difficult to remember now, given the ferocity with which many Republicans assail it as an attack on freedom, but the provision in President Obama's healthcare law requiring all Americans to buy health insurance has its roots in conservative thinking.\\\"[49][56]\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nThe reform negotiations also attracted a great deal of attention from lobbyists,[80] including deals between certain lobby groups and the advocates of the law to win the support of groups which had opposed past reforms, as in 1993.[81][82] The Sunlight Foundation documented many of the reported ties between \\\"the healthcare lobbyist complex\\\" and politicians in both major parties.[83]\\nDuring the August 2009 summer congressional recess, many members went back to their districts and entertained town hall meetings to solicit public opinion on the proposals. Over the recess, the Tea Party movement organized protests and many conservative groups and individuals targeted congressional town hall meetings to voice their opposition to the proposed reform bills.[69] There were also many threats made against members of Congress over the course of the Congressional debate.[84][85]\\nTo maintain the progress of the legislative process, when Congress returned from recess, in September 2009 President Obama delivered a speech to a joint session of Congress supporting the ongoing Congressional negotiations, to re-emphasize his commitment to reform and again outline his proposals.[86] He acknowledged the polarization of the debate, and quoted a letter from the late Senator Edward \\\"Ted\\\" Kennedy urging on reform: \\\"what we face is above all a moral issue; that at stake are not just the details of policy, but fundamental principles of social justice and the character of our country.\\\"[87] On November 7, the House of Representatives passed the Affordable Health Care for America Act on a 220\\u2013215 vote and forwarded it to the Senate for passage.[69]\\nSenate\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nThe Senate began work on its own proposals while the House was still working on the Affordable Health Care for America Act. Instead, the Senate took up H.R. 3590, a bill regarding housing tax breaks for service members.[88] As the United States Constitution requires all revenue-related bills to originate in the House,[89] the Senate took up this bill since it was first passed by the House as a revenue-related modification to the Internal Revenue Code. The bill was then used as the Senate's vehicle for their healthcare reform proposal, completely revising the content of the bill.[90] The bill as amended would ultimately incorporate elements of proposals that were reported favorably by the Senate Health and Finance committees. With the Republican minority in the Senate vowing to filibuster any bill they did not support, requiring a cloture vote to end debate, 60 votes would be necessary to get passage in the Senate.[91] At the start of the 111th Congress, Democrats had only 58 votes; the Senate seat in Minnesota ultimately won by Al Franken was still undergoing a recount, and Arlen Specter was still a Republican.\\nTo reach 60 votes, negotiations were undertaken to satisfy the demands of moderate Democrats, and to try to bring several Republican senators aboard; particular attention was given to Bob Bennett, Mike Enzi, Chuck Grassley, and Olympia Snowe. Negotiations continued even after July 7 \\u2014 when Franken was sworn into office, and by which time Specter had switched parties \\u2014 due to disagreements over the substance of the bill, which was still being drafted in committee, and because moderate Democrats hoped to win bipartisan support. Then, on August 25, before the bill could come up for a vote, Ted Kennedy\\u2014a longtime healthcare reform advocate\\u2014died, depriving Democrats of their 60th vote. Before Kennedy's seat was filled, attention was drawn to Snowe because of her vote in favor of the draft bill in the Finance Committee on October 15, but she explicitly stated that this did not mean she would support the final bill.[74] Paul Kirk was appointed as Senator Kennedy's temporary replacement on September 24.\\nAfter the Finance Committee vote, negotiations turned to the demands of moderate Democrats, whose votes would be necessary to break the anticipated Republican filibuster. Majority leader Harry Reid focused on satisfying the Democratic caucus's centrist members until the holdouts came down to Joe Lieberman of Connecticut, an independent who caucused with Democrats, and Ben Nelson, a conservative Democrat, representing Nebraska. Lieberman, despite intense negotiations with Reid in search of a compromise, refused to support a public option, agreeing to vote for the bill only if the provision were not included,[74][92] although it had majority support in Congress. His demand was met.[93] There was debate among the bill's supporters over the importance of the public option,[94] although the vast majority of supporters concluded it was a minor part of the reform overall,[92] and Congressional Democrats' fight for it won various concessions, including conditional waivers allowing states to set up state-based public options such as Vermont's Green Mountain Care.[93][95]\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nSenate vote by state.\\n\\u00a0\\u00a0Democratic yes (58)\\n\\u00a0\\u00a0Independent yes (2)\\n\\u00a0\\u00a0Republican no (39)\\n\\u00a0\\u00a0Republican not voting (1)\\n\\n\\n\\nWith every other Democrat now in favor and every Republican now opposed, the White House and Reid moved on to addressing Nelson's concerns in order to win filibuster-proof support for the bill;[96] they had by this point concluded \\\"it was a waste of time dealing with [Snowe]\\\"[97] because, after her vote for the draft bill in the Finance Committee, she had come under intense pressure from the Republican Senate leadership.[98] After a final 13-hour negotiation, Nelson's support for the bill was won with two concessions: a compromise on abortion, modifying the language of the bill \\\"to give states the right to prohibit coverage of abortion within their own insurance exchanges\\\", which would require consumers to pay for the procedure out of pocket if the state so decided; and an amendment to offer a higher rate of Medicaid reimbursement for Nebraska.[69][99] The latter half of the compromise was derisively called the \\\"Cornhusker Kickback\\\"[100] and was repealed in the subsequent reconciliation amendment bill.\\nOn December 23, the Senate voted 60\\u201339 to end debate on the bill: a cloture vote to end the filibuster. The bill then passed, also 60\\u201339, on December 24, 2009, with all Democrats and two independents voting for it, and all Republicans against (except Jim Bunning, who did not vote).[101] The bill was endorsed by the AMA and AARP.[102]\\nSeveral weeks later, on January 19, 2010, Massachusetts Republican Scott Brown was elected to the Senate in a special election to replace the late Ted Kennedy, having campaigned on giving the Republican minority the 41st vote needed to sustain Republican filibusters.[69][103][104] The special election had become significant to the reform debate because of its effects on the legislative process. The first was psychological: the symbolic importance of losing Kennedy's traditionally Democratic Massachusetts seat made many Congressional Democrats concerned about the political cost of passing a bill.[105][106] The second effect was more practical: the loss of the Democratic supermajority complicated reform proponents' legislative strategy.[106]\\nHouse\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nHouse vote by congressional district.\\n\\u00a0\\u00a0Democratic yea (219)\\n\\u00a0\\u00a0Democratic nay (34)\\n\\u00a0\\u00a0Republican nay (178)\\n\\u00a0\\u00a0No representative seated (4)\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nPresident Obama signing the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act on March 23, 2010.\\n\\n\\nBrown's election meant Democrats could no longer break a filibuster in the Senate. In response, White House Chief of Staff Rahm Emanuel argued that Democrats should scale back to a less ambitious bill; House Speaker Nancy Pelosi pushed back, dismissing Emanuel's scaled-down approach as \\\"Kiddie Care.\\\"[107][108] Obama also remained insistent on comprehensive reform, and the news that Anthem Blue Cross in California intended to raise premium rates for its patients by as much as 39% gave him a new line of argument to reassure nervous Democrats after Scott Brown's win.[107][108] On February 22, President Obama laid out a \\\"Senate-leaning\\\" proposal to consolidate the bills.[109] He held a meeting with both parties' leaders on February 25. With Democrats having lost a filibuster-proof supermajority in the Senate but having already passed the Senate bill with 60 votes on December 24, comprehensive reform proponents' most workable option was for the House to abandon its bill, the Affordable Health Care for America Act, and pass the Senate's bill, the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act, instead.\\nVarious health policy experts encouraged the House to pass the Senate version,[110] but House Democrats were not happy with it and had expected to be able to negotiate changes in a House-Senate conference before passing a final bill.[106] With that option off the table, since any bill that emerged from conference that differed from the Senate bill would have to be passed in the Senate despite another Republican filibuster, most House Democrats agreed to pass the Senate bill on condition that it be amended by a subsequent bill.[106] They drafted the Health Care and Education Reconciliation Act, which could be passed by the reconciliation process.[107][111][112]\\nUnlike rules under regular order, as per the Congressional Budget Act of 1974, reconciliation cannot be subject to a filibuster. But reconciliation is limited to budget changes, which is why the procedure was not used to pass the ACA in the first place; the bill had inherently non-budgetary regulations.[113][114] Still, although the already passed Senate bill could not have been passed by reconciliation, most of House Democrats' demands were budgetary: \\\"these changes\\u2014higher subsidy levels, different kinds of taxes to pay for them, nixing the Nebraska Medicaid deal\\u2014mainly involve taxes and spending. In other words, they're exactly the kinds of policies that are well-suited for reconciliation.\\\"[111]\\nThe remaining obstacle was a pivotal group of pro-life Democrats led by Bart Stupak who were initially reluctant to support the bill. The group found the possibility of federal funding for abortion significant enough to warrant opposition. The Senate bill had not included language that satisfied their abortion concerns, but they could not include additional such language in the reconciliation bill as it would be non-budgetary and thus outside the process's domain. Instead, Obama issued Executive Order 13535, reaffirming the principles in the Hyde Amendment.[115] This won the support of Stupak and members of his group and assured the bill's passage.[112][116] The House passed the Senate bill with a 219\\u2013212 vote on March 21, 2010, with 34 Democrats and all 178 Republicans voting against it.[117] The next day, Republicans introduced legislation to repeal the bill.[118] Obama signed the ACA into law on March 23, 2010.[119] The amendment bill, The Health Care and Education Reconciliation Act, was also passed by the House on March 21; the Senate passed it by reconciliation on March 25, and Obama signed it on March 30.\\nImpact\\nPublic policy\\nThe Affordable Care Act represents the most significant regulatory overhaul of the U.S. healthcare system since the passage of Medicare and Medicaid in 1965.[120] The New York Times summarized the overall impact of the Affordable Care Act on a variety of dimensions during October 2014. The number of uninsured persons has been reduced significantly. About 7.3 million people remain enrolled in private coverage through the online marketplaces; 85% of those qualified for federal subsidies to help pay premiums. For those who qualified for subsidies through the federal exchange, the subsidies lowered the cost by 76% on average. Middle-income persons who don't qualify for subsidies are more likely to have challenges with premium costs. It is too early to tell whether the Act has affected health outcomes. While healthcare costs have grown slower in recent years, the effect of ACA on this trend is unclear. The healthcare industry has generally been helped by the law, due to the additional customers the law created for it.[121]\\nChange in number of uninsured\\n\\nThe ACA has two primary mechanisms for increasing insurance coverage: expanding Medicaid eligibility to include individuals within 138% of the federal poverty level,[40] and creating state-based insurance exchanges where individuals and small business can buy health insurance plans\\u2014those individuals with incomes between 100% and 400% of the federal poverty level will be eligible for subsidies to do so.[29][35] The Congressional Budget Office (CBO) originally estimated that the legislation will reduce the number of uninsured residents by 32\\u00a0million, leaving 23\\u00a0million uninsured residents in 2019 after the bill's provisions have all taken effect.[122][123][124] With the elderly covered by Medicare, the CBO estimate projected that the law would raise the proportion of insured non-elderly citizens from 83% to 94%.[122] A July 2012 CBO estimate raised the expected number of uninsured by 3 million, reflecting the successful legal challenge to the ACA's expansion of Medicaid.[125][126]\\nAmong the people who will remain uninsured:\\n\\nACA drafters believed that increasing insurance coverage would not only improve quality of life but also help reduce medical bankruptcies (currently the leading cause of bankruptcy in America[129]) and job lock.[130] In addition, many believed that expanding coverage would help ensure that the cost controls successfully function; healthcare providers could more easily adapt to payment system reforms that incentivize value over quantity if their costs were partially offset\\u2014for example, hospitals having to do less charity care or insurers having larger and more stable risk pools to distribute costs over.[131]\\nDue to the new regulations of guaranteed issue, and allowing children to be included on their parents' plans until age 26, several insurance companies announced that they would stop issuing new child-only policies.[132][133][134] However, because children would now be covered by their parents' plans, the Census Bureau found that the number of uninsured 19- to 25-year-olds had declined by 1.6% or 393,000 people by 2011.[135] Starting January 1, 2014, state health insurance exchanges will be required to offer a child-only coverage option, and Medicaid eligibility will be made available to 16 million individuals with incomes below 133% of the federal poverty level.[136]\\nUnder the law, those workers whose employers offer \\\"affordable coverage\\\" will not be eligible for subsidies in the exchanges. To be eligible, per the law's definition, the cost of employer-based health insurance must exceed 9.5% of the worker\\u2019s household income. In January 2013 the Internal Revenue Service ruled that only the cost of covering the individual employee would be considered in determining whether the cost of coverage exceeded 9.5% of income. However, the cost of a family plan is often higher, but the ruling means that those higher costs will not be considered even if the extra premiums push the cost of coverage above the 9.5% income threshold. The New York Times said this could leave 2\\u20134 million Americans unable to afford family coverage under their employers\\u2019 plans and ineligible for subsidies to buy coverage elsewhere.[137][138]\\nMultiple 2014 studies and surveys indicated that the number of uninsured had fallen due to expanded Medicaid eligibility and health insurance exchanges established due to PPACA. These changes took effect January 1, 2014. The Commonwealth Fund reported in July 2014 that an additional 9.5 million people aged 19\\u201364 had obtained health insurance, roughly 5% of the working-aged population.[139] Gallup reported in July 2014 that the uninsured rate among adults 18 and over fell from 18.0% in Q3 2013 to 13.4% by Q2 2014.[140] The Rand Corporation reported that by March 2014: \\\"Enrollment in employer-sponsored insurance plans increased by 8.2 million and Medicaid enrollment increased by 5.9 million, although some individuals did lose coverage during this period. The authors also found that 3.9 million people are now covered through the state and federal marketplaces \\u2014 the so called insurance exchanges \\u2014 and less than 1 million people who previously had individual-market insurance became uninsured during the period in question. While the survey cannot tell if this latter group lost their insurance due to cancellation or because they simply felt the cost was too high, the overall number is very small, representing less than 1 percent of people between the ages of 18 and 64.\\\"[141] Thereafter, data from August 2014 showed that 7.3 million people had enrolled through the marketplace and paid their premiums.[142]\\nInsurance exchanges and the individual mandate\\n\\n\\nThe Act establishes state-based health insurance exchanges. The exchanges are regulated, online marketplaces, administered by either federal or state government, where individuals and small business can purchase private insurance plans starting October 1, 2013, with coverage beginning January 1, 2014.[29][143][144] Individuals with incomes between 100% and 400% of the federal poverty level who purchase insurance plans via an exchange will be eligible to receive federal subsidies to help pay premium costs.[28][35]\\nThe exchanges will take the form of websites where the private plans allowed on sale within them will be regulated and comparable: Consumers will be able to visit these websites or ring a call center, compare the plans on offer, fill out a form to the government that will be used to determine their eligibility for subsidies, and then purchase the insurance of their choice from the options available during limited open enrollment periods.[145] The first open enrollment period will last from October 1, 2013 to March 31, 2014, after which time uninsured individuals generally may not purchase insurance through an exchange until the following open enrollment period. In subsequent years, the open enrollment period will start on October 15 and end on December 7.[146][147] Despite some controversy, Members of Congress and their staff will participate in this system: they are required to obtain health insurance through the exchanges or plans otherwise approved by the bill (such as Medicare) instead of the Federal Employees Health Benefits Program that they currently use.[148]\\nThe insurance exchanges are a method designed to create a market for private insurance in a way that addresses market failures, such as the high number of uninsured, medical bankruptcies, coverage limits, unaffordability, and inflation[149] through regulation:[150][92] Only approved plans that meet certain standards will be allowed to be sold on the exchanges, and insurers will be prohibited from denying insurance to consumers on the basis of pre-existing conditions.[17][18] Several methods will be employed to make these plans affordable: Subsidies will be provided to those eligible.[35][38] Regulations intended to reduce prices through competition will make plans and prices more transparent and price comparisons more accessible for consumers with online information;[151][152][153] and federally approved, multi-state plans will be phased-into state exchanges[154] to help guarantee enough options.[155] And price regulations will be implemented, including a minimum medical loss ratio,[156] and partial community rating that prevents price discrimination from pricing individuals out of the market through unaffordable plans or premium increases on the insured[144][157]\\u2014namely poor and sick individuals who are more expensive to cover for insurers motivated either by profit maximization and\\/or the economics of insurance; specifically, the risk of an insurance pool not providing enough net-premiums to offset net-pay-outs.[158]\\nThese regulations are enabled to function due to the individual mandate[25] \\u2014 the requirement to buy insurance or pay a penalty\\u2014and the limits on open enrollment,[147][159] without which healthy people might put-off insuring themselves until they got sick. In such a situation, insurers would have to raise their premiums to afford the remaining (relatively sicker and thus more expensive) population,[25][160][161] which could create a vicious cycle in which more and more people drop their coverage \\u2013 a result known as an insurance death spiral.[162] Alternatively, the process could settle at a stable equilibrium relying on relatively high premiums for the insured and less coverage (and thus more illness and medical bankruptcy) for the uninsured.[157][160][163] The absence of the Mandate would have likely caused the exchanges as a whole to malfunction, and ultimately perform similarly to the current private insurance market, according to its supporters,[164][165] based on studies by the CBO, Jonathan Gruber, and Rand Health have concluded.[166][167][168] Conversely, the inclusion of the mandate increases the size and diversity of the insured population, broadening the risk pool to spread the cost of insurance in a sustainable manner.[169] Policy experience in New Jersey on the one hand and Massachusetts on the other offers evidence of such divergent outcomes.[157][167][170] In September 2012, the Congressional Budget Office estimated that nearly six million will pay the penalty in 2016.[171][172]\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nHealth insurance exchanges by state.[173]\\n\\u00a0\\u00a0Creating state-operated exchanges\\n\\u00a0\\u00a0Establishing state-federal partnership exchanges\\n\\u00a0\\u00a0Defaulting to federal exchange\\n\\n\\n\\nUnder the law, setting up an exchange gives a state partial discretion on standards and prices of insurance, aside from those specifics set-out in the ACA.[174][175] For example, those administering the exchange will be able to determine which plans are sold on or excluded from the exchanges, and adjust (through limits on and negotiations with private insurers) the prices on offer. They will also be able to impose higher or state-specific coverage requirements\\u2014including whether plans offered in the state are prohibited from covering abortion (making the procedure an out-of-pocket expense) or mandated to cover abortions that a physician determines is medically necessary; in either case, federal subsidies are prohibited from being used to fund the procedure.[176][177] If a state does not set up an exchange itself, they lose that discretion, and the responsibility to set up exchanges for such states defaults to the federal government, whereby the Department of Health and Human Services assumes the authority and legal obligation to operate all functions in these federally facilitated exchanges.[174] As of May 2013, 23 states and the District of Columbia plan to operate state-based exchanges themselves, seven of which will do so in partnership with the federal government\\u2014an arrangement where they retain discretionary management but the federal government executes various functions. The remaining 27 states default to federally facilitated exchanges.[173]\\nThe law is also designed to be flexible by allowing states, from 2017 onwards, to apply for a \\\"waiver for state innovation\\\" from the federal government that allows them to experiment with their own state-based system, on condition that it meets certain criteria.[178] To obtain a waiver, a state must pass legislation setting up an alternative health system that provides insurance at least as comprehensive and as affordable as that the ACA would, covers at least as many residents, and does not increase the federal deficit.[179] Provided a state meets these conditions, receiving a waiver can exempt states from some of the central requirements of the ACA, including the individual mandate, the provision of an insurance exchange, and the employer mandate.[180] The state would also receive compensation equal to the aggregate amount of any federal subsidies and tax credits for which its residents and employers would have been eligible under the ACA plan, if they cannot be paid out due to the structure of the state plan.[178]\\nIn May 2011, Vermont, a state in which Republicans are but a small minority, had enacted Green Mountain Care, a state-based single-payer system for which they intended to pursue a waiver to implement.[181][182][183] In December 2014, Vermont decided not to pursue the single-payer system.[184]\\nImplementation\\nMain article: HealthCare.gov\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nEarly implementation efforts for the healthcare exchanges, especially the exchanges operated by the federal government, have received nearly universally negative reactions in the media and from politicians.[185][186][187] HealthCare.gov, the website that allows people to apply for insurance through the exchanges operated by the federal government, crashed on opening and suffered from a rash of problems throughout the first month.[188] Many users have also found the available plans to be unattractive.[189][190][191][192] Ongoing problems with the website have prompted the development of HealthSherpa, an independently produced alternative to HealthCare.gov, that contains consumer information.[193][194]\\nVarious committees in both chambers of Congress have conducted hearings where cyber security concerns related to HealthCare.gov have been discussed. Experts disagree over the extent HealthCare.gov is vulnerable to cyber attacks.[195][196][197][198]\\nAs of March 2013, \\\"radio ads providing information on the Affordable Care Act\\\" have been broadcast in Ojibwe, Yupik, Inupiat, Lakota and Navajo, according to Indian Country Today Media Network.[199]\\nThe House Energy and Commerce Committee reported on April 30, 2014, that 67% of individuals and families who had selected a health plan in the Federally Facilitated Marketplace had paid their first month\\u2019s premium; and that 25% of paid enrollees are ages 18 to 34.[200] On the same day, Committee ranking member Henry A. Waxman issued a statement saying the reporting was \\\"... inaccurate, irresponsible, and out-of-date\\\" accompanied by a memorandum detailing the basis behind his statement.[201] A week later, representatives for top health insurance companies told members of Congress that more than 80 percent of people who've signed up under the new health care law have gone on to pay their premiums.[202]\\nOn July 30, 2014, the Government Accountability Office released a non-partisan study that concluded the administration did not provide \\\"effective planning or oversight practices\\\" in developing the HealthCare.gov website.[203]\\nChange in insurance standards\\nThe ACA includes regulations that set standards for insurance,[20] some specified in the law, others subsequently established by the Secretary of Health and Human Services. Among these new standards are a ban on the ability to drop policyholders if they become sick,[204] a ban on price discrimination on the basis of pre-existing conditions or sex through a partial community rating,[205] and allowing children and dependents to remain on their parents' insurance plan until their 26th birthday.[206][207]\\nUnder the law's authorization, Secretary of Health Kathleen Sebelius issued a set of defined \\\"essential health benefits\\\"[21] that all new insurance plans have to include. Insurers are prohibited from imposing annual or lifetime coverage caps on these essential benefits.[204][208] These cover: \\\"ambulatory patient services; emergency services; hospitalization; maternity and newborn care; mental health and substance use disorder services, including behavioral health treatment; prescription drugs; rehabilitative and habilitative services and devices; laboratory services; preventive and wellness services and chronic disease management; and pediatric services, including oral and vision care.\\\"[209][210] In determining what would qualify as an essential benefit, the law requires that the scope of standard benefits should equal that of a \\\"typical employer plan.\\\"[209] States have some discretion in determining what should be considered the benchmark plan within the requirements of the law, and may include services beyond those set out by the Secretary.[211]\\nAmong the essential health benefits, preventive care, childhood immunizations and adult vaccinations, and medical screenings are covered by an insurance plan's premiums, and cannot be subject to any co-payments, co-insurance, or deductibles.[212][213] Specific examples of such services covered include: mammograms and colonoscopies, wellness visits, gestational diabetes screening, HPV testing, STI counseling, HIV screening and counseling, FDA-approved contraceptive methods, breastfeeding support and supplies, and domestic violence screening and counseling.[214]\\n In addition, the law established four tiers of coverage: bronze, silver, gold, and platinum. All categories offer the same set of essential health benefits. What the categories specify is the division of premiums and out-of-pocket costs: bronze plans will have the lowest monthly premiums and highest out-of-pocket costs, and vice versa for platinum plans.[209][215] The percentages of health care costs that plans are expected to cover through premiums (as opposed to out-of-pocket costs) are, on average: 60% (bronze), 70% (silver), 80% (gold), and 90% (platinum).[216]\\nInsurers are also required to implement an appeals process for coverage determination and claims on all new plans.[204] They are also required to spend at least 80\\u201385% of premium dollars on health costs and claims instead of administrative costs and profits; rebates must be issued to policyholders if this is violated.[217][218]\\nCoverage for contraceptives\\n\\nOne provision in the law mandates that health insurance cover \\\"additional preventive care and screenings\\\" for women, as specified in regulations to be issued by the Health Resources and Services Administration (HRSA).[219] The HRSA guidelines, issued August 1, 2011, included in this mandate \\\"[a]ll Food and Drug Administration approved contraceptive methods, sterilization procedures, and patient education and counseling for all women with reproductive capacity\\\".[220] This mandate applies to all employers and educational institutions except for religious organizations.[221][222] These regulations were included on the recommendations of the Institute of Medicine, which concluded that access to contraception is medically necessary \\\"to ensure women's health and well-being.\\\"[223][224]\\nThe initial regulations proved controversial among certain religious groups, most notably evangelicals and Lutherans, and especially the Roman Catholic hierarchy, whose hospitals, charities and educational institutions of higher learning, as well as other enterprises, oppose contraception on doctrinal grounds.[225] To accommodate those concerns while still guaranteeing access to contraception, the regulations were adjusted to \\\"allow religious organizations to opt out of the requirement to include birth control coverage in their employee insurance plans. In those instances, the insurers themselves will offer contraception coverage to enrollees directly, at no additional cost.\\\"[226]\\nThe contraception rule has also been challenged by corporations as a burden against their religious expression. The first challenge to reach the Supreme Court was Burwell v. Hobby Lobby.[227] The Court ruled that closely held corporations, such as Hobby Lobby, would be exempt from the contraception rule under the Religious Freedom Restoration Act, which applies to regulations that govern the activities of closely held for-profit corporations.[228] In a follow up case to Burwell v. Hobby Lobby the U.S. Supreme Court issued an injunction pending appeal under which an evangelical college in Illinois and other religiously affiliated nonprofit groups will not have to fill out a form offered to religious nonprofits that would effectively transfer the cost of its employees\\u2019 contraceptives to insurers. Wheaton College argued that filling out the form would \\u201ctrigger\\u201d emergency contraceptive coverage and is therefore still against the institution\\u2019s religious beliefs.[229][230][231][232][233][234]\\nEffects on insurance premiums\\nSeveral studies on insurance premiums expect that with the subsidies offered under the ACA, more people will pay less (than they did prior to the reforms) than those who will pay more, and that those premiums will be more stable (even in changing health circumstances) and transparent, due to the regulations on insurance.[235][236][237] The Kaiser Family Foundation has calculated that about half the people who currently buy insurance on their own today will be eligible for subsidies. Among those receiving subsidies (which excludes those with incomes above four times the poverty line \\u2014 about $46,000 for individuals or $94,000 for a family of four), the subsidies are projected to be worth an average of $5,548 per household, which would effectively discount the projected price of insurance by two-thirds, on average.[238] For individuals, NPR and the Kaiser Family Foundation collaborated to produce a quick online calculator for people to estimate their premiums and subsidy amount, based on where they live, income, and family size.[237]\\nFor the effect on health insurance premiums, the CBO forecast that by 2016 the individual market would comprise 17% of the market, and that premiums per person would increase by 10% to 13% but that over half of these individuals would receive subsidies that would decrease the premium paid to \\\"well below\\\" premiums charged under current law.[239][240] It also forecast that for the small group market, 13% of the market, premiums would be impacted 1% to \\u22123%, and \\u22128% to \\u221211% for those receiving subsidies; for the large group market comprising 70% of the market, premiums would be impacted 0% to \\u22123%, with those under high premium plans subject to excise taxes being charged \\u22129% to \\u221212% less. Factors taken into account by this analysis included: increased benefits particularly for the individual market, more healthy policyholders due to the mandate, administrative efficiencies related to the health exchanges, and high-premium insurance plans reducing some benefits in response to the tax.[240] As of September 2013, the final projections of the average monthly premium scheduled to be offered in the exchanges came in below CBO expectations, reducing expected costs not only for consumers but also for the government by reducing the overall cost of the subsidies.[241][242][243][244]\\nLarry Levitt, a health policy analyst from the Kaiser Family Foundation, noted that the individual market compromises a relatively small share of those under 65, and said, in contrast, \\\"I don't think anyone expects significant [cost] increases in the employer market,\\\" where the majority of Americans get their health insurance. Secretary of Health and Human Services Kathleen Sebelius also indicated that some cost increase in the individual market was expected because the standard of insurance allowed in the insurance exchanges would be higher quality than that generally available currently (and thus more expensive), and that the government subsidies provided to make insurance affordable are intended to more than offset this effect.[245]\\nIn June 2013, a study by the Kaiser Family Foundation focused on actual experience under the Act as it affected individual market consumers (those buying insurance on their own). The study found that the Medical Loss Ratio provision of the Act had saved this group of consumers $1.2 billion in 2011 and $2.1 billion in 2012, reducing their 2012 costs by 7.5%.[156] The bulk of the savings were in reduced premiums for individual insurance, but some came from premium rebates paid to consumers by insurance companies that had failed to meet the requirements of the Act. The Associated Press reported that, as a result of ACA's provisions closing the Medicare Part D coverage gap (between the \\\"initial coverage limit\\\" and the \\\"catastrophic coverage threshold\\\" in the prescription drug program), individuals formerly falling in this \\\"donut hole\\\" would save about 40 percent.[246] Almost all [clarification needed] of the savings came reportedly because, with regard to brand-name drugs, ACA secured a discount from pharmaceutical companies.[246] The change benefited more than two million people, most of them in the middle class.[246]\\nHealthcare cost inflation\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nU.S. healthcare cost inflation from 2000 to 2011.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nU.S. healthcare costs as a percentage of GDP from 2000 to 2011.\\n\\n\\nIn a May 2010 presentation on \\\"Health Costs and the Federal Budget\\\", the CBO stated that \\\"Rising health costs will put tremendous pressure on the federal budget during the next few decades and beyond. In CBO's judgment, the health legislation enacted earlier this year does not substantially diminish that pressure.\\\"[247]\\nThe CBO further observed that \\\"Putting the federal budget on a sustainable path would almost certainly require a significant reduction in the growth of federal health spending relative to current law (including this year's health legislation).\\\"[247] and concluded,\\n\\n... there is considerable agreement that a substantial share of current spending on health care contributes little if anything to people's health, and providers and health analysts are making significant efforts to make the health system more efficient... [though] it is not clear what specific policies the federal government can adopt to generate fundamental changes in the health system; that is, it is not clear what specific policies would translate the potential for significant cost savings into reality.[247]\\n\\nJonathan Cohn, a health policy analyst, commented:\\n\\nCBO doesn't produce estimates of how reform will affect overall health care spending \\u2014 that is, the amount of money our society, as a whole, will devote to health care. But the official actuary for Medicare does. The actuary determined that ... the long-term trend is towards less spending: Inflation after ten years would be lower than it is now. And it's the long-term trend that matters most ... [The Affordable Care Act] will reduce the cost of care\\u2014not by a lot and not by as much as possible in theory, but as much as is possible in this political universe.[131][248]\\n\\nHe and fellow The New Republic editor Noam Scheiber claimed the CBO did not include in its estimate various cost-saving provisions intended to reduce health inflation,[249] also positing that the CBO has a history of consistently underestimating the impact of health legislation.[250]\\nJonathan Gruber, a consultant who helped develop both the Massachusetts healthcare reform under Mitt Romney and the ACA,[64] has acknowledged that the ACA is not guaranteed to significantly \\\"bend the curve\\\" of rising healthcare costs:[251]\\n\\nThe real question is how far the ACA will go in slowing cost growth. Here, there is great uncertainty\\u2014mostly because there is such uncertainty in general about how to control cost growth in health care. There is no shortage of good ideas for ways of doing so ... There is, however, a shortage of evidence regarding which approaches will actually work\\u2014and therefore no consensus on which path is best to follow. In the face of such uncertainty, the ACA pursued the path of considering a range of different approaches to controlling health care costs ... Whether these policies by themselves can fully solve the long run health care cost problem in the United States is doubtful. They may, however, provide a first step towards controlling costs\\u2014and understanding what does and does not work to do so more broadly.[252]\\n\\nThe law created the Center for Medicare and Medicaid Innovation and requires numerous pilot programs and demonstrations that may affect healthcare costs.[253] These cost reductions were not factored into CBO cost estimates.[254]\\nThe Business Roundtable, an association of CEOs, commissioned a report from the consulting company Hewitt Associates which found that the legislation \\\"could potentially reduce that trend line by more than $3,000 per employee, to $25,435,\\\" with respect to insurance premiums. It also stated that the legislation \\\"could potentially reduce the rate of future health care cost increases by 15% to 20% when fully phased in by 2019.\\\" The group cautioned that all of this would be dependent upon the success of the cost-saving government pilot programs which must then be wholly copied in the private market.[255]\\nThe Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services reported in 2013 that, while costs per capita continue to rise, the rate of increase in annual healthcare costs has fallen since 2002. Per capita cost increases have averaged 5.4% annually since 2000. Costs relative to GDP, which had been rising, have stagnated since 2009.[256] Several studies have attempted to explain the reduction in the rate of annual increase. Reasons include, among others:\\n\\nHigher unemployment due to the 2008-2010 recession, which has limited the ability of consumers to purchase healthcare;\\nOut-of-pocket payments, and deductibles, which constitute the amount an individual pays for their health costs before insurance begins to cover claims, have risen. These rising costs generally cause less consumption of healthcare services.[257] The proportion of workers with employer-sponsored health insurance requiring a deductible climbed to about three-quarters in 2012 from about half in 2006.[258][259]\\nStructural changes[258] in the healthcare system made by the ACA that aim to shift the healthcare system from paying-for-quantity to paying-for-quality. Examples include incentives to reduce hospital infections and to use electronic medical records, accountable care organizations, and bundled payments to coordinate care and prioritize quality over quantity.[260] Some of these changes have occurred due to healthcare providers acting in anticipation of future implementation of reforms.[260][261]\\n\\nUncertainty exists about the extent to which each factor is responsible for the recent reduction in health inflation, and about the durability of the overall trend, including the accompanying reduction in long-term deficit projections due to reduced healthcare costs. However, several studies found that the temporary effects of the recession cannot account for the entirety of the slowdown and that structural changes likely share at least partial credit.[258][261][262][263]\\nOne study estimated that the changes to the health system are responsible for about a quarter of the recent reduction in inflation.[264] Paul Krawzak posits that even if cost controls succeed in reducing the amount spent on healthcare, such efforts on their own may be insufficient to outweigh the long-term burden placed by demographic changes, particularly the growth of the population on Medicare.[265]\\nFederal deficit\\nCBO estimates of revenue and impact on deficit\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nCBO: Deficit reduction under the ACA; the \\\"bump\\\" is from the coverage expansion starting 2014[266]\\n\\n\\nThe 2011 comprehensive CBO estimate projected a net deficit reduction of more than $200 billion during the 2012\\u20132021 period:[267][268] it calculated the law would result in $604 billion in total outlays offset by $813 billion in total receipts, resulting in a $210 billion net reduction in the deficit.[267] The CBO separately noted that while most of the spending provisions do not begin until 2014,[269][270] revenue will still exceed spending in those subsequent years.[271] The CBO averred that the bill would \\\"substantially reduce the growth of Medicare's payment rates for most services; impose an excise tax on insurance plans with relatively high premiums; and make various other changes to the federal tax code, Medicare, Medicaid, and other programs\\\"[239]\\u2014ultimately extending the solvency of the Medicare trust fund by 8 years.[272]\\nHowever, this estimate was made prior to the Supreme Court's ruling that enabled states to opt out of the Medicaid expansion, thereby forgoing the federal funding. The CBO and JCT subsequently updated the budget projection, estimating the impact of the ruling would reduce the cost estimate of the insurance coverage provisions by $84 billion.[124][273][274]\\nMajor sources of deficit reduction include:[212] higher Medicare taxes on the wealthy; new annual fees on health insurance providers; similar fees on the healthcare industry such as manufacturers and importers of brand-name pharmaceutical drugs and certain medical devices; limits on tax deductions of medical expenses and flexible spending accounts; a new 40% excise tax on \\\"Cadillac\\\" insurance policies - plans with annual insurance premiums in excess of $10,200 for an individual or $27,500 for a family; revenue from mandate penalty payments; a 10% federal sales tax on indoor tanning services; and spending offsets such as a reduction in Medicare reimbursements to insurers and drug companies for private Medicare Advantage policies that the Government Accountability Office and Medicare Payment Advisory Commission found to be overpaid (relative to government Medicare);[275][276] and reductions in Medicare reimbursements to hospitals that do not meet standards of efficiency and care.[275]\\nAlthough the CBO generally does not provide cost estimates beyond the 10-year budget projection period because of the degree of uncertainty involved in the projection, it decided to do so in this case at the request of lawmakers, and estimated a second decade deficit reduction of $1.2\\u00a0trillion.[239][277] CBO predicted deficit reduction around a broad range of one-half percent of GDP over the 2020s while cautioning that \\\"a wide range of changes could occur\\\".[278]\\nA commonly heard complaint regarding the CBO cost estimates is that CBO was required to exclude from its initial estimates the effects of likely \\\"doc fix\\\" legislation that would increase Medicare payments by more than $200\\u00a0billion from 2010 to 2019.[279][280][281] However, the \\\"doc fix\\\" is a separate issue that would have existed whether or not the ACA became law - omitting its cost from the ACA is no different from omitting the cost of the Bush tax cuts.[282][283][284]\\nOpinions on CBO projections\\nThere was mixed opinion about the CBO estimates. Uwe Reinhardt, a health economist at Princeton, wrote that \\\"The rigid, artificial rules under which the Congressional Budget Office must score proposed legislation unfortunately cannot produce the best unbiased forecasts of the likely fiscal impact of any legislation\\\", but went on to say \\\"But even if the budget office errs significantly in its conclusion that the bill would actually help reduce the future federal deficit, I doubt that the financing of this bill will be anywhere near as fiscally irresponsible as was the financing of the Medicare Modernization Act of 2003.\\\"[285] Douglas Holtz-Eakin, CBO director during the George W. Bush administration, who later served as the chief economic policy adviser to U.S. Senator John McCain's 2008 presidential campaign, alleged that the bill would increase the deficit by $562\\u00a0billion because, he argued, it front-loaded revenue and back-loaded benefits.[286]\\nThe New Republic editors Noam Scheiber and Jonathan Cohn, countered critical assessments of the law's deficit impact, arguing that it is as likely, if not more so, for predictions to have underestimated deficit reduction than to have overestimated it. They noted that it is easier, for example, to account for the cost of definite levels of subsidies to specified numbers of people than account for savings from preventive healthcare, and that the CBO has a track record of consistently overestimating the costs of, and underestimating the savings of health legislation;[249][250] \\\"innovations in the delivery of medical care, like greater use of electronic medical records[287] and financial incentives for more coordination of care among doctors, would produce substantial savings while also slowing the relentless climb of medical expenses... But the CBO would not consider such savings in its calculations, because the innovations hadn't really been tried on such large scale or in concert with one another\\u2014and that meant there wasn't much hard data to prove the savings would materialize.\\\"[249]\\nDavid Walker, former U.S. Comptroller General now working for The Peter G. Peterson Foundation, has stated that the CBO estimates are not likely to be accurate, because they are based on the assumption that Congress is going to do everything they say they're going to do.[288] The Center on Budget and Policy Priorities objected: in its analysis, Congress has a good record of implementing Medicare savings. According to their study, Congress followed through on the implementation of the vast majority of provisions enacted in the past 20\\u00a0years to produce Medicare savings.[289][290]\\nEmployer mandate and part-time working hours\\n\\nNot to be confused with the individual mandate[291][292]\\n\\n\\nThe employer mandate is a penalty that will be incurred by employers with more than 50 employees that do not offer health insurance to their full-time workers.[293] This provision was included as a disincentive for employers considering dropping their current insurance plans once the insurance exchanges began operating as an alternative source of insurance.[294] Proponents of the reform law wanted to address the parts of the healthcare system they believed to not be working well, while causing minimal disruption to those happy with the coverage they have.[295][294] Lawmakers recognized that approximately 80% of Americans already have insurance, of whom 54% (44% of the total population) are covered directly or indirectly through an employer, and 29% (23% of the total population) are covered by the government\\u2014mainly though Medicare and Medicaid.[296][297] While 73% of the total population reported themselves satisfied with their insurance situation, significant minorities, even among those that reported favorably, had medically-related financial troubles and\\/or dissatisfaction with aspects of their insurance coverage, especially among the poor and sick.[295] The intent of the employer mandate (along with a grandfather clause in the ACA) is to help ensure that existing employer-sponsored insurance plans that people like will stay in place.[294]\\nAs no company with fewer than 50 full-time employees will face this penalty, many[who?] are concerned that the employer mandate creates a perverse incentive for business to employ people part-time instead of full-time.[298][299] This hypothetical phenomenon has sometimes been referred to by commentators on both sides of the political spectrum as \\\"The Obamacare Effect.\\\"[300][301][302]\\nDespite concerns over a massive spike in part-time workers driven by cost-cutting efforts on the part of large employers, the number of part-time jobs in the United States had, in fact, declined by 230,000, while the number of full-time jobs has increased by 2 million during the period leading up to the start-date of Obamacare as of early 2014.[302][303] Where full-time jobs have turned into part-time jobs seems to be in the public-sector, as an effort to reduce state and federal deficits, rather than as an effort to maintain or increase corporate profits in the private sectors (the original fear of individuals who coined the term 'Obamacare Effect').[302][304]\\nSeveral businesses and the State of Virginia have clarified the contracts of their part-time employees by adding a 29-hour-a-week cap,[305][unreliable source?][306][unreliable source?] to reflect the 30-hour threshold for full-time hours, as defined by the law.[293] Some labor market experts claim such shifts are not clearly attributable to the implementation of the ACA: pre-existing, long-term trends in working hours,[307] and the effects of the Great Recession correlate with part-time working hour patterns.[308][309] The impact of this provision on employers' decision-making is partially offset by other factors: offering healthcare helps attract and retain employees, while increasing productivity and reducing absenteeism; and to trade a smaller full-time workforce for a larger part-time work force carries costs of training and administration for a business.[299][307][310] The amount of employers with over 50 employees is relatively [clarification needed] small,[299] and more than 90% of these already offer insurance,[311] so changes in employer plans from this provision are expected to be small.[298] Workers who do not receive insurance from an employer plan would be able to purchase insurance on the exchanges.[312]\\nRegardless of the rationale for maintaining existing insurance arrangements for those happy with them, most policy analysts (on both the right and left) are critical of the employer mandate provision on the policy merits.[298][311] They argue that the perverse incentives regarding part-time hours, even if they do not change many existing insurance plans, are real and harmful;[313][314] that the raised marginal cost of the 50th worker for businesses could limit companies\\u2019 growth;[315] that the costs of reporting and administration\\u2014the paperwork for businesses and the state enforcement\\u2014are not worth the trade-off of incentivizing the maintenance of current employer plans;[313][314] and note that the employer mandate, unlike the individual mandate, is a non-essential part of the law.[316][292] Some analysts have suggested that an alternate 'pay or play' version of the employer mandate would partially avoid these problems, by instead taxing business that do not offer insurance by a percentage of their payroll rather than using the 50-employee and 30-hour cut-offs.[298][313][314] Furthermore, many healthcare policy analysts think it would be better to transition away from the employer-based system to systems (whether state- or market-based) where insurance is more portable and stable, and hence think that it is a bad idea to even try to maintain existing employer insurance systems.[317] The effects of the provision have also generated vocal opposition from business interests and some unions not granted exemptions.[314][318]\\nOn July 2, 2013, the Obama Administration announced on the Treasury Department's Proposed Regulations REG-138006-12[319] would delay the implementation of the employer mandate for one year, until 2015.[311][320]\\nA 2013\\/4 survey by the National Association for Business Economics found that about 75 percent of those surveyed said the ACA hasn\\u2019t influenced their planning or expectations for 2014, and 85 percent said the law wouldn\\u2019t prompt a change in their hiring practices. Some 21 percent of 64 businesses surveyed said that the act would have a harmful effect and 5 percent said it would be beneficial.[321]\\nOn 10 February 2014, the Treasury Department issued Treasury Decision 9655, which are final regulation, that it would delay the employer mandate until 2015.[319] The Treasury Decision 9655 modifies Proposed Regulations REG-138006-12.[319]\\nChanges in existing individual insurance plans\\nAt various times during and after the debate surrounding the ACA, Obama stated that \\\"if you like your health care plan, you'll be able to keep your health care plan\\\".[322][323] However, the law grandfathers only those insurance plans that were in effect before the law was enacted and have not been significantly changed since then.[323] Plans that do not satisfy these criteria must be cancelled if they do not comply with the law's new requirements for insurance standards. Furthermore, the law does not prohibit insurers from cancelling older plans for other reasons, such as a determination that a plan is too expensive to maintain. For these reasons, in fall 2013 millions of Americans with individual policies received notices that their insurance plans were being terminated,[324] and several million more are in danger of seeing their current plans cancelled.[325][326][327]\\nOn November 7, 2013, President Obama stated: \\\"I am sorry that [people losing their plans] are finding themselves in this situation based on assurances they got from me\\\", and he promised to work to help the affected Americans.[328] Various acts have been introduced in Congress to allow people to keep their existing individual insurance plans.[329] President Obama's previous unambiguous assurance that consumers' could keep their own plans has become a focal point for critics of the ACA[330][331] and a political liability for the law's proponents.[332][333] Whether or not President Obama knew that his statements were incorrect at the time he made them has also become the focus of discussion.[323][334][335]\\nClawback controversy\\nThe asset-recovery provision of Medicaid, nicknamed the \\\"clawback\\\" provision, was enacted in 1993 by Congress in response to rising Medicaid administrative costs. States were compelled to try to recover costs from the estates of the deceased who used the program for long-term care, either via liens placed on an individual's home or claims on their assets. There was also an option for states to recover other routine medical care expenses. The expansion of Medicaid under the Affordable Care Act made more residents eligible for Medicaid. The state and federal government as of February 2014 have not clarified clawback guidelines, triggering complaints from consumers and advocacy groups from the uncertainty.[336]\\nHospitals\\nFrom the start of 2010 to November 2014, 43 hospital in rural areas closed, according to the North Carolina Rural Health Research Program. Critics of the Affordable Care Act have stated that the new law has caused these hospitals to close. Many of these rural hospitals were built using funds from the 1946 Hill\\u2013Burton Act, to increase access to medical care in rural areas. Some of these hospitals have re-opened as other forms of medical facilities, but only a small number of those re-opened facilities operate emergency rooms or urgent care centers.[337]\\nPublic opinion\\nPublic opinion polls indicate that the United States public generally supports healthcare reform, but the public's views became increasingly negative in reaction to specific plans discussed during the legislative debate over 2009 and 2010. Polling statistics for the general population show a general negative opinion of the law in the first years; with those in favor at approximately 40% and those against at 51%, as of October 2013.[338][339] About 29% of whites approve of the law, compared with 61% of Hispanics and 91% of African Americans, according a Pew Research Center and USA Today survey conducted on 4\\u20138 September 2013.[340] USA Today found opinions were strongly divided by age of the person at the law's inception, with a solid majority of seniors opposing the bill and a solid majority of those younger than forty years old in favor.[341]\\nSpecific elements are very popular across the political spectrum, with the notable exception of the mandate to purchase insurance. FiveThirtyEight, describing public opinion of the law, said, \\\"while surveys have consistently found that a plurality of Americans have an overall negative view of the Affordable Care Act, they have just as consistently shown that large majorities of Americans favor individual elements of the law.\\\"[342][343] For example, a Reuters-Ipsos poll during June 2012 indicated that 44% of Americans supported the law, with 56% against. By party affiliation, 75% of Democrats, 27% of Independents, and 14% of Republicans favored the law overall. Individual provisions of the law received varying levels of support: 82% favored banning insurance companies from denying coverage to people with pre-existing conditions, 61% favored allowing children to stay on their parents' insurance until age 26, 72% supported requiring companies with more than 50 employees to provide insurance for their employees, and 39% supported the individual mandate to own insurance or pay a penalty. By party affiliation, 19% of Republicans, 27% of Independents, and 59% of Democrats favored the mandate.[344] Other polls showed additional provisions receiving majority support include the creation of insurance exchanges, pooling small businesses and the uninsured with other consumers so that more people can take advantage of large group pricing benefits, and providing subsidies to individuals and families to make health insurance more affordable.[345][346] Other specific ideas that were not enacted but which showed majority support included importing prescription drugs from Canada (with its lower, government-controlled prices),[347] limiting malpractice awards, reducing the age to qualify for Medicare, and the Public health insurance option.[348]\\nPollsters probed the reasons for opposition.[349] In a CNN poll, 62% of respondents said they thought the ACA would \\\"increase the amount of money they personally spend on health care\\\", 56% said the bill \\\"gives the government too much involvement in health care\\\", and 19% said they thought they and their families would be better off with the legislation.[350] Other polls found that people were concerned that the law would cost more than projected, and would not do enough to control the cost of health care affecting their families.[351]\\nHowever, part of the opposition to the law is because some Americans believe the reform did not go far enough: A Reuters-Ipsos poll indicated that, for those opposed to the bill, 71% of Republican opponents reject it overall while 29% believed it did not go far enough; independent opponents were divided 67% to 33%; and among the relatively much smaller group of Democratic opponents, 49% reject it overall, and 51% wanted the measure to go further.[344]\\nAs of 2011 many Democrats believed that the ACA would grow more popular over time, like Medicare did after its implementation,[352] as the benefits of the law take effect and close the information gap about the contents of the bill.[342][343][353]\\nIn June 2013, a majority of the public (52\\u201334%) indicated a desire for \\\"Congress to implement or tinker with the law rather than repeal it\\\".[354] Following the Supreme Court upholding the constitutionality of the individual mandate in National Federation of Independent Business v. Sebelius, a poll released in July 2012 showed that \\\"most Americans (56%) want to see critics of President Obama's health care law drop efforts to block it and move on to other national issues.\\\"[355] The RAND Health Reform Opinion Study for May 1, 2014, showed that 48.9% of respondents had an unfavorable view of the ACA vs. 38.3% who had a favorable view (of more than 5,500 individuals).[356]\\nPolling averages from RealClearPolitics showed public approval of the ACA as 52.1% against and 38.6% for (poll averages from February 27 to March 25, 2014).[338]\\nAn Associated Press-GfK poll released March 28, 2014 showed that 26% of Americans support the ACA.[357]\\nA Wall Street Journal\\/NBC poll released April 30, 2014, indicated that 8% of respondents say that the Affordable Care Act \\\"is working well the way it is.\\\"[358]\\nPolitical\\nTerm \\\"Obamacare\\\"\\nThe term \\\"Obamacare\\\" was originally coined by opponents of the Affordable Care Act as a pejorative term for the law. The term was first put in print in March 2007 when healthcare lobbyist Jeanne Schulte Scott penned it in a health industry journal, writing \\\"We will soon see a 'Giuliani-care' and 'Obama-care' to go along with 'McCain-care', 'Edwards-care', and a totally revamped and remodeled 'Hillary-care' from the 1990s\\\".[14][359] According to research by Elspeth Reeve at The Atlantic magazine, the expression Obamacare first was used in early 2007, generally by writers describing the candidate's proposal for expanding coverage for the uninsured.[360] The word was first uttered in a political campaign by Mitt Romney in May 2007 in Des Moines, Iowa. Romney said, \\\"In my state, I worked on healthcare for some time. We had half a million people without insurance, and I said, 'How can we get those people insured without raising taxes and without having government take over healthcare?' And let me tell you, if we don't do it, the Democrats will. If the Democrats do it, it will be socialized medicine; it'll be government-managed care. It'll be what's known as Hillarycare or Barack Obamacare, or whatever you want to call it.\\\"[14]\\nBy mid-2012, Obamacare had become the most common colloquial term used to refer to the law by both supporters and opponents. In contrast, the use of \\\"Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act\\\" or \\\"Affordable Care Act\\\" became limited to more formal and official use.[360] Use of the term in a positive sense was suggested by Democrat John Conyers.[361] President Obama endorsed the nickname, saying, \\\"I have no problem with people saying Obama cares. I do care.\\\"[362] Because of the number of \\\"Obamacare\\\" search engine queries, the Department of Health and Human Services purchased Google advertisements, triggered by the term, to direct people to the official HHS site.[363] In March 2012, the Obama reelection campaign embraced the term \\\"Obamacare\\\", urging Obama's supporters to post Twitter messages that begin, \\\"I like #Obamacare because...\\\".[364] After its debut as a phrase on Capitol Hill, according to an analysis by the Sunlight Foundation, from July 2009 to June 2012 the term \\\"Obamacare\\\" was used nearly 3,000 times in congressional speeches.[14]\\nIn October 2013 the Associated Press and NPR began cutting back on use of the term.[365] Stuart Seidel, NPR's managing editor, said that the term \\\"seems to be straddling somewhere between being a politically-charged term and an accepted part of the vernacular\\\".[366]\\nCommon misconceptions\\n\\\"Death panels\\\"\\nMain article: Death panel\\nOn August 7, 2009, Sarah Palin claimed the proposed legislation would create \\\"death panels\\\" that would decide if sick and elderly Americans were \\\"worthy\\\" of medical care.[367] The allegation was named PolitiFact's \\\"Lie of the Year\\\",[367][368] one of FactCheck's \\\"whoppers\\\",[369][370] and the most outrageous term by the American Dialect Society.[371] The AARP described such rumors as \\\"rife with gross\\u2014and even cruel\\u2014distortions.\\\"[372] In 2010, the Pew Research Center reported that 85% of Americans were familiar with the claim, and 30% believed it was true, with three contemporaneous polls finding similar results.[373] A poll in August 2012 found that 39% of Americans still believed the \\\"death panels\\\" claim.[374]\\nThe \\\"death panel\\\" misconception distorts separate issues initially related to two proposed provisions found in the early drafts of the ACA. One was a claim that under the law, seniors can be denied care due to their age[375] and the other that the government will advise them to end their own lives instead of receiving due care[376] \\u2014 the former eventually morphing into alluding to the Independent Payment Advisory Board (IPAB), which was established with the passage of the ACA, instead.[376] The IPAB has the authority to determine then recommend additional cost-saving changes to the Medicare program by facilitating the adoption of additional cost-effective treatments and similar cost-recovering measures when the statutory levels set for the administration of the Medicare program are exceeded within any given 3-year cycle scheduled. In fact, the Board is prohibited from recommending changes that would reduce payments to certain providers before 2020, and is also prohibited from recommending changes in premiums, benefits, eligibility and taxes, or other changes that would result in rationing.[377][378]\\nThe other related issue concerns advance-care planning consultation: a section of the House reform proposal would have reimbursed physicians for providing voluntary consultations of Medicare recipients on end-of-life health planning (which is also covered by many private plans), enabling patients to specify, on request, the kind of care they wish to receive in their old age.[379] As described by the site Snopes.com, \\\"This provision would allow patients to prepare for the day when they might be seriously ill and unable to make medical decisions for themselves by engaging in consultations with doctors to discuss the full range of end-of-life care options available to them, and to have the cost of such consultations covered by Medicare ... [including] directives to accept or refuse extreme life-saving measures, selection of hospice care programs, appointment of relatives\\\" to act on the patient's behalf, etc.[372] The provision was not included in the final draft of the 2009 bill that was enacted into law.[380]\\nExemptions for Congressmen\\nA separate common misconception about the ACA is that members of Congress are exempt from the Act's reforms. In fact, the ACA requires members of Congress and their staffs to obtain health insurance either through an exchange or some other program approved by the law (such as Medicare), instead of using the insurance offered to federal employees (the Federal Employees Health Benefits Program). The federal government will continue to maintain its contributions to the new health insurance plans of federal employees.[148][381][382][383][384]\\nBenefits for illegal immigrants\\nAnother common misconception is that the ACA provides benefits to illegal immigrants.[385] In fact, the ACA explicitly denies insurance subsidies to \\\"unauthorized (illegal) aliens\\\".[122][127][386]\\nOpposition and resistance\\nEfforts to oppose and repeal the legislation have drawn support from prominent conservative advocacy groups,[387][388] Congressional and many state Republicans, certain small business organizations, and the Tea Party movement.[389] These groups believe the law will lead to disruption of existing health plans, increased costs from new insurance standards, and that it will increase the deficit.[390] Some are also against the idea of universal healthcare, viewing insurance as similar to other commodities to which people are not entitled.[391][392]\\nAs of 2013[update] unions that have expressed concerns about the negative impact the ACA will have on their members' health care benefits, included the AFL-CIO,[393] which called the ACA \\\"highly disruptive\\\" to union health care plans and said it would drive up costs of union-sponsored plans; and International Brotherhood of Teamsters, United Food and Commercial Workers International Union, and UNITE-HERE, leaders of which sent a letter to Harry Reid (D-NV) and Nancy Pelosi (D-CA) stating that \\\"the ACA will shatter not only our hard-earned health benefits, but destroy the foundation of the 40 hour work week that is the backbone of the American middle class.\\\"[394] In January 2014, Terry O\\u2019Sullivan, president of the Laborers\\u2019 International Union of North America (LIUNA) and D. Taylor, president of Unite Here sent a letter to Harry Reid (D-NV) and Nancy Pelosi (D-CA) stating that, \\\"The ACA, as implemented, undermines fair marketplace competition in the health care industry.\\\"[395]\\nLegal challenges\\n\\nOpponents of the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act turned to the federal courts to challenge the constitutionality of the legislation.[396][397] In National Federation of Independent Business v. Sebelius, decided on June 28, 2012, the Supreme Court ruled on a 5\\u20134 vote that the individual mandate is constitutional under Congress's taxation powers, although the law could not have been upheld under Congress's regulatory power under the Commerce Clause. The Court also determined that states could not be forced to participate in the Medicaid expansion, effectively allowing states to opt out of this provision. As written, the ACA withheld all Medicaid funding from states declining to participate in the expansion. The Supreme Court ruled that this withdrawal of funding was unconstitutionally coercive and that individual states had the right to opt out of the Medicaid expansion without losing preexisting Medicaid funding from the federal government. All provisions of ACA will continue in effect or will take effect as scheduled subject to the states' determination on Medicaid expansion.[398]\\nIn March 2012 the Roman Catholic Church, while supportive of the ACA's objectives, has voiced concern through the United States Conference of Catholic Bishops that aspects of the mandate covering artificial contraception and sterilization and HHS's narrow definition of a religious organization were violations of the First Amendment right to free exercise of religion and conscience. Numerous lawsuits are pending addressing these concerns.[399][400]\\nState rejections of Medicaid expansion\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nMedicaid expansion by state.[401]\\n\\u00a0\\u00a0Expanding Medicaid\\n\\u00a0\\u00a0Considering Medicaid expansion\\n\\u00a0\\u00a0Not expanding Medicaid\\n\\n\\n\\nFollowing the Supreme Court ruling in NFIB v. Sebelius, several states with legislatures or governorships controlled by Republicans opted to reject the expanded Medicaid coverage provided for by the Act. Over half of the national uninsured population lives in those states.[402] As of September 2014[update], with the addition of Pennsylvania, 27 states and the District of Columbia have adopted the Medicaid expansion; a few states have remained undecided.[401][403][404] States that declined to expand Medicaid before 2014 may still choose to opt in at any time.[405]\\nThe drafters of the ACA had intended for Medicaid to cover individuals and families with incomes up to 133% (138% under effective definitions of income[40]) of the federal poverty level by expanding Medicaid eligibility and simplifying the CHIP enrollment process. Low-income individuals and families above 100% and up to 400% of the federal poverty level were to receive federal subsidies[35] on a sliding scale if they choose to purchase insurance via an exchange. For example, individuals with incomes between 133% and 150% of the poverty level would be subsidized such that their premium cost would be 3% to 4% of their income.[36] The Supreme Court ruling created the potential for a coverage gap. States that chose to reject the Medicaid expansion could maintain the pre-existing Medicaid eligibility thresholds they have set, which in many states are significantly below 133% of the poverty line for most individuals.[406] Furthermore, many states do not make Medicaid available to childless adults at any income level.[407] Because subsidies on insurance plans purchased through exchanges are not available to those below the poverty line, this created a coverage gap in those states between the state Medicaid threshold and the subsidy eligibility threshold.[408][409] For example, in Kansas, where only those able-bodied adults with children and with an income below 32% of the poverty line are eligible for Medicaid, those with incomes from 32% to 100% of the poverty level ($6,250 to $19,530 for a family of three) would be ineligible for both Medicaid and federal subsidies to buy insurance. If they have no children, able-bodied adults are not eligible for Medicaid in Kansas.[402] Studies of the impact of state decisions to reject the Medicaid expansion, as of July 2013, calculate that up to 6.4 million Americans could fall into this coverage gap.[410]\\nFor states that do expand Medicaid, the federal government pays for 100% of the expansion through 2016, and the subsidy tapers to 90% by 2020.[405] Several opposing states argue that their 10% responsibility of funding the expansion will be too much for their states' budgets.[405][411] Studies suggest that rejecting the expansion will cost states more than expanding Medicaid due to increased spending on uncompensated emergency care that otherwise would have been partially paid for by Medicaid coverage.[412]\\nNon-cooperation\\nOfficials in Texas, Florida, Alabama, Wyoming, Arizona, Oklahoma and Missouri have decided to oppose those elements of the ACA over which they have discretion.[413][414] For example, Missouri declined to expand Medicaid or establish a health insurance marketplace but is also engaged in an active program of non-cooperation, having enacted a statute forbidding any state or local official to render any aid not specifically required by federal law to the functioning of the Affordable Care Act.[415] Other Republican politicians have tried to discourage efforts to advertise the benefits of the law, and some conservative political groups have launched ad campaigns to discourage enrollment.[416][417]\\nRepeal efforts\\nThe ACA has been the subject of unsuccessful repeal efforts by Republicans in the 111th, 112th, and 113th Congresses: U.S. House Reps Steve King (R-IA) and Michele Bachmann (R-MN) introduced bills in the House to repeal the ACA the day after it was signed, as did Senator Jim DeMint (R-SC) in the U.S. Senate.[418] In 2011, after Republicans gained control of the House of Representatives, one of the first votes held was on a bill entitled \\\"Repealing the Job-Killing Health Care Law Act\\\" (H.R. 2), which the House passed on a 245\\u2013189 vote.[419] All Republicans and 3 Democrats voted for repeal.[420] House Democrats proposed an amendment that repeal not take effect until a majority of the Senators and Representatives had opted out of the Federal Employees Health Benefits Program; Republicans voted down the measure.[421] In the Senate, the bill was offered as an amendment to an unrelated bill but was voted down.[422] President Obama had stated that he would have vetoed the bill even if it had passed both chambers of Congress.[423]\\nFollowing the 2012 Supreme Court ruling upholding the ACA as constitutional, Republicans held another vote to repeal the law on July 11;[424] the House of Representatives voted with all 244 Republicans and 5 Democrats in favor of repeal, which marked the 33rd, partial or whole, repeal attempt.[425][426] With President Obama's reelection and the Democrats expanding their majority in the Senate following the 2012 elections, many Republicans conceded that repeal almost certainly will not occur.[427] On February 3, 2015 the House of Representatives added its 67th repeal vote to the record with 239 to 186 and nine members abstaining, moving the action to the Senate, where Republican Senator Ted Cruz, (R-Texas), introduced legislation for full repeal with vote on 9-2-2015.[428]\\n2013 federal government shutdown\\nStrong partisan disagreement in Congress has prevented adjustments to the Act's provisions.[429] However, at least one change, a proposed repeal of a tax on medical devices, has received bipartisan support.[430] Some Congressional Republicans argue against improvements to the law on the grounds they would weaken the arguments for repeal.[291][314]\\nRepublicans attempted to defund its implementation,[414][431] and in October 2013, House Republicans, supported by Senators Rand Paul, Ted Cruz, Mike Lee, and Marco Rubio, refused to fund the federal government unless accompanied with a delay in implementation of the ACA, after the President unilaterally pushed back the employer mandate by one year, which critics claim he had no legal right to do. The Republican-held House of Representatives passed three versions of a bill funding all elements of the government while submitting various versions which would repeal or delay the ACA, with the last version delaying enforcement of the \\u201cindividual mandate\\u201d. These bills were unable to muster enough votes in the Democrat-held Senate, with Democratic leadership stating the Senate would only pass a \\\"clean\\\" funding bill without any restrictions on the ACA. After Congress failed to pass a continuing funding resolution by midnight on October 1, a government shutdown ensued.[432][433][434] Conservative groups such as Heritage Action provided lobbying support for the linkage between the ACA and the government shutdown.[435][436][437] Senate Republicans threatened to block appointments to relevant agencies, such as the Independent Payment Advisory Board[438] and Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services.[439][440]\\nEconomic consequences\\nUntil passage of the ACA, the majority of US citizens had a company sponsored insurance plan, and the U.S. was the only rich nation where this was the case. Companies began offering insurance policies during World War II to attract talent from the reduced supply of workers, a practice later cemented by tax policies that encouraged untaxed benefits (such as health care) rather than taxable ones such as cash. Offering insurance in lieu of cash compensation made corporations responsible for their employee's health. Rising insurance costs coupled with rising salaries squeezed both benefits and salaries until aging workers found their salaries stagnating and their benefits cut.[441]\\nAs of 2014 large company policies were still the norm, since tax laws until 2018 make benefits cheaper than cash, but many employees have been losing their \\\"paternalistic\\\" corporate policies and must find their own insurance. With the insurance system introduced under the ACA, employers who stopped their company sponsored insurance plan eliminated one of their largest compensation benefits, and shifted more costs on to employees. These include insurance premiums rising to 28% in 2013, compared with 26% in 2003, according to the Kaiser Family Foundation, and more workers paying deductibles of $1,000 reaching 38% in 2013, more than twice what it was in 2008. According to one study, as of 2014, only 25% of firms saw themselves offering any insurance in 10 years.[441]\\nTo avoid the ACA requirements[442] for firms over 50 people, smaller firms have been reducing their workforces to part-time workers, usually one hour below the federal requirement for full-time work.[citation needed] This will improve hiring and salary while simultaneously improve the efficiency of healthcare policies and worker mobility.[citation needed]\\nThe House Republican leadership put forth the argument in favor of repeal that \\\"this is a job-killing law, period.\\\"[443] They contended that the ACA would lead to a loss of 650,000 jobs, attributing the figure to a report by the Congressional Budget Office.[443] However, FactCheck noted that the 650,000 figure was not included in the CBO report referred to, saying that the Republican statement \\\"badly misrepresents what the Congressional Budget Office has said about the law. In fact, CBO is among those saying the effect [on employment] 'will probably be small.'\\\"[443] PolitiFact rated the Republican statement as false.[444]\\nJonathan Cohn, citing the projections of the CBO, summarized that the primary employment effect of the ACA is to alleviate job lock: \\\"People who are only working because they desperately need employer-sponsored health insurance will no longer do so.\\\"[445] He concluded that the \\\"reform's only significant employment impact was a reduction in the labor force, primarily because people holding onto jobs just to keep insurance could finally retire\\\" because they have health insurance outside of their jobs.[446]\\nImpact of repeal on federal budget projections\\nIn May 2011, the nonpartisan Congressional Budget Office (CBO) analyzed proposals to repeal the law. Mirroring its analysis of the law itself, the CBO estimated that repealing the entire law (both its taxing and spending provisions) would increase the net 2011\\u20132021 federal deficit by $210 billion.[447][448] Revised CBO accounting, following the July 11, 2012, House repeal vote (H.R. 6079), and taking into account the impact of Supreme Court ruling, was consistent with its previous estimate: that repeal would cause a net increase in federal budget deficits of $109 billion over the 2013\\u20132022 period.[449]\\nSee also\\n\\n\\nReferences\\n\\n\\n^ Pear, Robert (July 7, 2012). \\\"Health Law Critics Prepare to Battle Over Insurance Exchange Subsidies\\\".

Humphries II claimed under oath that he \\\"was told by supervisors that\\\" the 2012 presidential election \\\"would explain the potential reason why there was so much interference\\\" in the case \\\"from headquarters, that nobody wanted this case during an election cycle.\\\"The deposition is part of the lawsuit brought by Dr. Scott and Jill Kelley against government agencies, departments and major figures in the Obama administration for allegedly defaming their character in the Petraeus-Broadwell sex scandal. The affair between Petraeus and Broadwell, his biographer-turned mistress, brought a disgraced end to the decorated general's career.Though the Kelleys were the victims of the original cyberstalking case, as the Petraeus scandal exploded in the public, Jill Kelley's name was dragged through the mud by unnamed Obama administration and law enforcement officials and many in the media painted her in a particularly unflattering light, the subject of the Kelley's lawsuit.Petraeus pleaded guilty last month to one federal charge of removing and retaining classified information, having improperly shared his black books with Broadwell and lied about it to the FBI. He is scheduled to be sentenced on Thursday. READ: Petraeus says ISIS isn't the biggest long-term threat facing U.S.All charges against Broadwell were dropped in December 2012.Humphries testified he believed Kelley's name had been leaked by someone at FBI headquarters \\\"and it seemed to be a purposeful attempt to discredit both Mrs. Kelley and myself.\\\"Humphries said in his deposition he was confused by FBI's leaders' focus on Jill Kelley instead of Broadwell, whom they identified as the cyberstalker as early as June 2012. He testified her actions compromised security of high-level military intelligence personnel and information, but for some reason higher-ups in the FBI kept interfering in what seemed to him to be a fairly straightforward case. In one incident, FBI agents were called back from the airport as they were about to fly to North Carolina to interview Broadwell.All the while, the FBI kept shifting focus on the victims in the case, Humphries testified, or more specifically on Jill Kelley. He testified he would occasionally hear \\\"lewd comments\\\" from FBI agents about Kelley, including one individual making \\\"a comment that he was pleased that Mrs. Kelley was in the Citizens' Academy and that [he] had nominated her because of her [big] breasts.\\\"\\\"I couldn't understand why there was so much animosity\\\" against Jill Kelley amongst his FBI superiors, Humphries testified. \\\"[I]t was stated in some ways and reflected in the body language that their view was that Jill Kelley had sort of brought this on herself and was some femme fatale,\\\" he said. He wondered if this warped view of the case was rooted in \\\"ineptness, incompetence or was politically motivated,\\\" he testified.A  request for comment made by CNN to a representative of Paula Broadwell was not met by press time.Alan Raul, an attorney for the Kelleys, also declined comment to CNN on Sunday, as did Petraeus attorney Robert Barnett. A spokesman for the Justice Department did not return a call from CNN on Sunday; a spokesman for the FBI did not offer any comment. The administration has refrained from commenting on the case in the past given the current litigation.Other law enforcement officials told CNN what Humphries and others regarded as interference from headquarters could also be seen as efforts to ensure the FBI did everything by the book in a highly sensitive case. (They got court-approved warrants for things normally the FBI can administratively subpoena). Some at the FBI thought Humphries did things to keep inserting himself into the case even after he was told to recuse himself given that he had a friendly relationship with Kelley. Those efforts allegedly include attempts at communication that Humphries is sais to have had during the course of the investigations with then-House Majority Leader Eric Cantor, R-Virginia.He testified that he and his wife and children are friends with the Kelleys and their children through their outreach to the military and law enforcement communities in Tampa, and did not understand his bosses' insinuations or harsh judgments.Were some officials in the Obama administration attempting misdirection away from the CIA Director in the thick of the 2012 presidential race? Were they motivated by sexism or some other pre-judgment of Kelley? These are implicit and explicit suggestions in the lawsuit, respectively, but as of now there has not been any clear answer from the administration as to why -- according to the Kelleys' suit and Humphries' deposition -- law enforcement officials were so skeptical of Jill Kelley.FBI blaming the victims?The story began in May 2012, when four-star Gen. John Allen began receiving e-mails from \\\"kelleypatrol@gmail.com,\\\" which \\\"disparaged\\\" Kelley and referenced an upcoming private dinner the Kelleys were hosting with \\\"several senior foreign intelligence, defense and diplomatic officials,\\\" according to the lawsuit. The email troubled Allen given the potential security concern and \\\"frightened the Kelleys, as it indicated that Mrs. Kelley was being followed or stalked, and raised serious concerns about her own safety and well being, particularly given the number of terrorist risks faced by CENTCOM leaders.\\\"SEE: Petraeus pleads guilty to federal chargeBroadwell later admitted to having sent that email as well as another from \\\"Tampa Angel\\\" to Dr. Scott Kelley, also disparaging his wife, promising \\\"embarrassment for all, including spouses, such as info in national headlines.\\\"Jill Kelley reached out to Humphries, an FBI Agent whom she and her husband knew socially. \\\"She explained that Gen. Allen had received an odd e-mail,\\\" Humphries testified, noting that \\\"whoever sent these e-mails is either in close physical proximity or has penetrated the cyber security of these folks to include the director of the Central Intelligence Agency, Director Petraeus, and I was worried and concerned for his safety, the safety of the generals.\\\"Humphries thought the emails \\\"ominous\\\" and contacted Special Agent Adam Malone of the Tampa Cyber Squad. \\\"We had already reached the threshold on the cyber or physical security of senior government leadership and possible their email,\\\" he said.By the third week of June, the FBI had identified Broadwell as the cyberstalker, Humphries said, relating how he saw FBI videotape of \\\"a BMW pulling up to a Starbucks in North Carolina and shortly thereafter the alleged subject of the case enters and logs on, and some of the e-mails were being sent, so they had a firm idea of who it was.\\\"In an attempt to apparently suss out whatever rivalry or animus might exist between Broadwell and Kelley, Humphries was asked to call Kelley, \\\"sort of like a ruse like to see if Mrs. Kelley knew who the subject was.\\\" He did so, and asked her for a book recommendation for background on Petraeus. But Kelley didn't mention Broadwell or her book about the man with whom she'd had an affair, \\\"All In: The Education of David Petraeus.\\\"According to Humphries, when he raised the title of the book, Kelley said, \\\"Gen. Petraeus doesn't really like that book. He said the person who came and wrote it sort of came in for the guise of being an academic researcher and then ended up writing a book.\\\"Humphries said he was surprised Kelley didn't know the name of the book let alone the author. If Broadwell \\\"would have some animus against Mrs. Kelley, Mrs. Kelley doesn't even know who she is,\\\" he recalled thinking.Meanwhile, others in the FBI were heading in an altogether different direction with their judgments of the jet-setting socialites, Humphries said. \\\"I was surprised throughout the process of the marginalization of Mrs. Kelley as a victim in this case because I heard comments from them saying things like -- you know, I reminded them at one point, you may not agree with the lifestyle of the Kelleys, but they're victims in this crime,\\\" he testified.The special agent in charge, Steven Ibison, \\\"kind of rolled his eyes and snorted at the proposal that I said they were victims,\\\" Humphries said.\\\"The only victim is her husband because he has to pay for all the food that she goes out and eats and takes pictures of and sends to everyone,\\\" said Kevin Eaton, the assistant special agent in charge, according to Humphries. Kelley is often took photos of her food when she goes out to eat and sends them to her friends, a source close to Kelley said.It was a comment that \\\"shocked and surprised\\\" Humphries since it revealed that the FBI was looking at Kelley's e-mails beyond the ones relevant to the cyberstalking, contrary to Kelley's explicit instruction.\\\"Something was starting to shift in my mind to make me realize that they had a different view of this than how I understand what was taking place,\\\" he testified.This was all \\\"Completely counter to the Jill Kelley that I had known for three years and her husband, Scott Kelley. And I couldn't understand why there was so much angst over this very simple criminal case that could be resolved very quickly and expeditiously and yet was being made far more complicated,\\\" he said.But soon the FBI leaders would be challenging Humphries' integrity and marital fidelity as well.The FBI director \\\"just shoved these up my ass\\\"It's not surprising that a case involving cyberstalking of top generals and the CIA director would prompt the awareness of higher-ups at the FBI. But the behavior from those officials in Washington, shocked Humphries.In June 2012, Humphries was told by Stacy Arruda, FBI supervisory special agent with the Tampa Division of the Cyber Crime, FBI agents went to the airport to fly to North Carolina to interview Broadwell. \\\"But they were called back to have their questions reviewed,\\\" by Ibison, the special agent in charge, Humphries said. He said his understand was that deputy director of the FBI Joyce \\\"halted\\\" the interview of Broadwell, which was not consistent with FBI protocol.Arruda became so \\\"concerned and was frustrated by the high level of direction,\\\" Humphries said, she ultimately \\\"felt it was wise to keep a separate copy\\\" of all the evidence in the case. Ultimately Arruda told Humphries that higher-ups essentially removed her from the case.In July 2012, Joyce summoned Ibison out of meeting, Humphries testified. Humphries testified that he was later told that he was the subject of the discussion; Eaton, the assistant special agent in charge, told Humphries that Joyce and the director of the FBI Robert Mueller suggested that Humphries was having an inappropriate relationship with Jill Kelley.Humphries said he was \\\"completely blind-sided by that accusation and actually shocked and stunned ... I immediately denied it and offered to voluntarily take a polygraph at the same time.\\\" He said he was confused as to why the FBI focused on Kelley and him instead of Broadwell.In September 2012 Ibison \\\"summoned\\\" Humphries to a meeting and asked him \\\"whether there was anything in my communications with Jill Kelley for which I would be embarrassed,\\\" he testified.\\\"No,\\\" Humphries said, and Ibison \\\"threw a bunch of pictures at me and files of my e-mails to Jill Kelley.\\\"\\\"Well, I told the director that and he just shoved these up my ass,\\\" Ibison said, according to Humphries, \\\"and he tossed the pictures at me.\\\"The photographs to Humphries were completely innocent, including \\\"Halloween photos, photos at hookah bars with other employees ... One was a picture of the famous mannequin picture with me shirtless between the two, pictures that I had sent to all my supervisors and they had used at annual conferences as funny pictured from the division.\\\"The origin of the \\\"mannequin\\\" picture -- described in the media when the story broke in November 2012 as a \\\"shirtless photo\\\" the FBI agent sent to Jill Kelley -- was hardly seductive, as Humphries describes it.At a range in 2009, members of the SWAT team \\\"were joking that my bald head looked like the shirtless dummies that we had. And so somebody suggested that we take a picture ... And we took picture and it went out to 50 different people,\\\" Humphries said. \\\"I actually sent it to Scott Kelley's email address ... it was never meant to be anything but a joke.\\\"\\\"These are pictures you saw before,\\\" Humphries said, according to the deposition. Ibison's response was, \\\"Well, it was OK inside the FBI but not OK to share it outside the FBI,\\\" according to Humphries.Humphries left his meeting with Ibison under the impression that FBI Director Mueller believed \\\"that I had messed up the case for the government because of my ... alleged inappropriate misconduct with Mrs. Kelley, that I had ruined the government's case to ever be able to fully prosecute without embarrassing the bureau.\\\"Meanwhile, at this point Petraeus had not been interviewed.When Humphries asked his supervisor about the direction of the case, he was told, \\\"No one wants to be involved in a case like this during an election cycle.\\\"Election Day was Nov. 6, 2012. Three days later, Petraeus resigned, after which senior military and law enforcement officials leaked Kelley's name to the media. Accusations soon followed, with ABC News reporting that the FBI had \\\"uncovered 'potentially inappropriate' emails between Gen. Allen and Kelley\\\" and Fox News saying the officials \\\"characterize certain email communications as the \\\"'equivalent of phone sex over email,'\\\" charges the Kelleys vociferously deny.Jill Kelley's lawsuit states that her \\\"reputation is indelibly tainted ... consistently referred to as the 'center' of the 'sex scandal' and is often portrayed as the woman who brought down two American generals.\\\"In addition, amidst the wild media fracas of this case, Gen. Allen's anticipated promotion to Supreme Allied Commander of Europe for NATO was delayed until an investigation into his relationship with Kelley was completed. By the time he was cleared of all wrongdoing, Allen had retired from the military. Humphries has a long and decorated career with the FBI, working on the Joint Terrorism Task Forces in Seattle and Tampa, as well as serving as program manager for FBI operations at Bagram Air Force Base in Afghanistan. In 2002 he received the director's award for outstanding counterterrorism investigation for his work helping the thwart the would be Millennium bomber Ahmed Ressam; in 2012 he received the FBI Medal of Valor for a 2010 incident where he shot and killed a man wielding a knife outside MacDill Air Force Base. Among the many others whom will likely be deposed in the case are former FBI Deputy Director Sean Joyce, former Secretary of Defense Leon Panetta, and Secretary of the Department of Homeland Security Jeh Johnson, who at the time was general counsel at the Pentagon.CNN's Evan Perez contributed to this report.\",\n                \"source\": \"www.cnn.com\",\n                \"publishDate\": \"2015-04-20T04:20:49+02:00\",\n                \"sourceType\": \"web\",\n                \"language\": \"en\",\n                \"googleRank\": 9,\n                \"relatedDocs\": [\n\n                ]\n            },\n            {\n                \"id\": 186676322,\n                \"url\": \"http:\\/\\/robinwestenra.blogspot.com\\/2015\\/04\\/the-chinese-response-to-nz-spying.html\",\n                \"title\": \"\\n\\n\\nChina\\nconcerned at reports of New Zealand-U.S. plan to spy on diplomats\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n19\\nApril, 2014\\n\\n\\n\\nWELLINGTON,\\nApril 19 (Xinhua) -- China on Sunday expressed concern about a report\\nthat New Zealand \",\n                \"content\": \"\\n\\n\\nChina\\nconcerned at reports of New Zealand-U.S. plan to spy on diplomats\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n19\\nApril, 2014\\n\\n\\n\\nWELLINGTON,\\nApril 19 (Xinhua) -- China on Sunday expressed concern about a report\\nthat New Zealand and United States spy agencies planned to hack into\\na data link between Chinese government buildings in Auckland.\\n\\n\\n\\nThe\\nplan was revealed in documents from U.S. National Security Agency\\n(NSA) whistleblower Edward Snowden, the Herald on Sunday newspaper\\nreported.\\n\\n\\n\\nThe\\nproject run by New Zealand's Government Communications Security\\nBureau (GCSB) and the NSA appeared aimed at tapping data flowing\\nbetween the Chinese Consulate and its visa office in Auckland.\\n\\n\\n\\nThe\\ndocuments said the GCSB had identified the data link, and agreed to\\ncooperate with the NSA to use the link to access China's computer\\nsystems, said the report.\\n\\n\\n\\nDocuments\\nappeared to show the plan was codenamed \\\"Frostbite\\\" by the\\nGCSB and \\\"Basilhayden\\\" -- also identified as fictional spy\\nJames Bond's drink of choice -- by the NSA.\\n\\n\\n\\nThe\\npaperwork revealed the GCSB worked with the NSA's elite hacker team\\n-- the Tailored Access Operations division -- which specialized in\\ncracking computer systems and planting spyware on computers, said the\\nreport.\\n\\n\\n\\nA\\n2013 NSA document showed China at the top of a list of targets it was\\nhaving monitored by the GCSB, saying the New Zealand agency gave the\\nNSA \\\"access to areas and countries that are difficult for the\\nUnited States to access.\\\"\\n\\n\\n\\nBut\\nit is unknown if the plan went ahead because, as sign-off was being\\nsought, Snowden walked out of his job with a mass of top secret\\ndocuments.\\n\\n\\n\\nThe\\nChinese Embassy in New Zealand issued a statement Sunday, saying that\\nChina was concerned about the report and attached great importance to\\nthe cyber security issue.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\\"We\\nwill firmly safeguard our security interests and continue to\\nguarantee our cyber and information security with concrete measures,\\\"\\nsaid the statement.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\\"At\\npresent, cyber space is riddled with chaos and uncertainty.

Other security firms have tied the group to a breach in the US State Department, seeking information about President Barack Obama's travel schedule.\\n\\n        \\n        \\n\\n    \\n\\n

\"content\": \"James Risen, Pay Any Price: Greed, Power and Endless War (New York: Houghton Mifflin Harcourt, 2014).Following the events in Paris at Hebdo Charlie and the accompanying media frenzy concerning freedom of expression and freedom of the press, James Risen\\u2019s recent book Pay Any Price becomes, ironically, even more important than its original intention of uncovering the abuses of governmental power that tend to be hidden from view of the mainstream media.Much of what Risen writes about are the efforts of the government and its various agencies and cohorts trying to maintain secrecy around its efforts to keep the endless war going in order to keep the profits rolling in.Following on a previous expose on the CIA \\u00a0that highlighted the secrecy and manipulations of the CIA within the Bush \\u201cwar on terror\\u201d (State of War, Free Press, 2006), Pay Any Price highlights how the Obama administration is a continuation of the Bush administration. \\u201cObama\\u2019s great achievement\\u2014or great sin\\u2014was to make the national security state permanent\\u201d, he writes.Further, \\u201cAmerica has become accustomed to a permanent state of war\\u2026.the creation of a homeland security complex at a time of endless war has bequeathed us with the central narrative of the war on terror\\u2014modern tales of greed joined hand in hand with stories of abuse of power.\\u201dEach chapter focuses on one or two particular story lines to highlight the activities of these deeper government activities and their efforts to keep them quiet.\\u00a0 Quirky characters who managed to ingratiate themselves with the powerful in Washington are presented alongside those who have stood against the tide of corruption, secrecy, greed and power.Business, money and powerThe first chapter, \\u201cPallets of Cash\\u201d explores the billions of dollars in cash that were distributed in Iraq during the 2003 war, much of which went missing, unaccounted for, while a couple billion more are reportedly stored in a Lebanon \\u2018safe site\\u2019.\\u00a0 One of Risen\\u2019s current problems stems from the nature of his sources, many of whom he does not identify\\u2014for obvious reasons\\u2014but who are of interest to the powers that be in order to squelch them.\\u00a0 As for the billions of dollars of missing cash, one has to wonder how much of that has gone to fund the strange rise of ISIS, its well-armed devotees, and its well-trained units.In \\u201cThe Emperor of the War on Terror\\u201d, the story of Dennis Montgomery\\u2019s scam of the CIA creating \\u201cone of the most elaborate and dangerous hoaxes in American history\\u201d is outlined.\\u00a0 The CIA \\u201cburied the episode and acted like it never happened\\u2026trying to block any information about Montgomery and his schemes from becoming public.\\u201d\\u00a0\\u00a0 More wonder, as this puts into question all the \\u2018saves\\u2019 claimed by the government against supposed terrorist actions.As with all wars, money is to be made. \\u201cThe New Oligarchs\\u201d looks at the companies and personnel involved with the drone wars (General Atomics), Abu Ghraib (CACI), and the training of Afghan police (Dyncorp).\\u00a0 Power is the accompaniment to money.\\u00a0 In \\u201cRosetta\\u201d, Risen outlines the convoluted history of the 9\\/11 lawsuit against the Saudi financial elites.\\u00a0 It is an awkward story to follow as shady characters acting within the shadows of government (including some within government) work towards their own ends, not necessarily those of the plaintiffs.Risen writes, \\u201cThe web of relationships that developed among Motley Rice, Mike Asimos, Rosetta, the Pentagon, the FBI, and the DEA operated completely outside the government\\u2019s normal intelligence-gathering processes \\u2026 so dependent on personal contacts that few people in the government ever had the nerve to go back and try to unravel exactly what happened.\\u201dThe story of Rosetta shows how Bush \\u201creached for a national security answer to terrorism rather than a law enforcement solution \\u2026 using the courts was never an option.\\u201d\\u00a0 It also shows how \\u201cgreed and ambition have been married to unlimited rivers of cash\\u201d to create \\u201crogue intelligence operations with little or no adult supervision.\\u201dThese currents of cash, power and ambition continue in the next chapter, \\u201cAlarbus\\u201d, a tale of \\u201ca runaway covert action program\\u201d underscoring \\u201chow greed and the hunt for cash have all too often become the main objects of\\u00a0 the war on terror.\\u201dNot to be outdone for cash and power, \\u201cToo Big To Fail\\u201d looks at KBR, the spin off from Dick Cheney\\u2019s Halliburton, the former \\u201cconnected to the \\u2018vast majority\\u2019 of war-zone fraud cases referred to investigators.\\u201d\\u00a0\\u00a0 KBR became the \\u201cbiggest money machine of the Iraq war\\u201d, with a \\u201ccontracting bonanza on an unprecedented scale,\\u201d and a \\u201cvirtual monopoly over basic services,\\u201d giving KBR \\u201cenormous influence and inevitably helped shape the course of the war.\\u201dHumanityPart III, \\u201cEndless War,\\u201d has three chapters titled \\u201cThe War on\\u2026 Decency\\/Normalcy\\/Truth.\\u201d\\u00a0\\u00a0 The overriding theme concerns the lack of respect in general for humanity and what should be humanitarian principles of interaction domestically and with foreign affairs.\\u00a0 It is the story of torture, domestic security in the physical sense, and finally the efforts of the NSA to establish itself as the hub of cyberspace security around the world.The first idea, decency, examines the excuses and abuses for the application of torture, an idea that has surfaced before[1] and more recently with the Senate report condemning the CIA\\u2019s use of enhanced interrogation.\\u00a0 Risen\\u2019s story follows that of Damien Corsetti, who described Abu Ghraib by saying, \\u201cif an evil place ever existed, that was it.\\u00a0 It was all just death and fucking death.\\u00a0 That single place changed everyone who was there.\\u00a0 A cancerous growth went on there.\\u201d\\u00a0 As should be common knowledge, \\u201cThe only people who have been held to account are those who were at the very bottom of the chain of command.\\u201dThe whole torture archipelago, which extended well beyond Abu Ghraib and the CIA, \\u201cwas built on a myth \\u2026 despite strong evidence to the contrary.\\u201d The newly redefined torture tactics\\u2014\\u201cenhanced interrogation techniques\\u201d\\u2014\\u201chad been originally designed to break men and force them to spout lies and propaganda,\\u201d but the advocates claimed \\u201cthey would elicit the truth, and not lies and propaganda. In the upside down world of the global war on terror, their explanations were widely accepted.\\u201dAfter reading this chapter, another wonder rises:\\u00a0 why would anyone bother to visit a psychiatrist or psychologist, as they and their associations were complicit in the torture setup.\\u201cThe War on Normalcy\\u201d first explores the towns of Derbyline, VT, and Stanstead, Quebec, really just one village bisected by the international border and, before 9\\/11, without any concerns about citizens meandering back and forth going about their daily business.\\u00a0 That of course changed post 9\\/11, as one resident said, \\u201cThere\\u2019s no negotiating with these people [Homeland Security].\\u00a0 It\\u2019s totally senseless.\\u00a0 There is no thought put into it.\\u00a0 Al Qaeda has won.\\u00a0 They have changed our lives.\\u201d\\u00a0 Big business, big money, has also won.To this day, \\u201cThe rush to transform the United States from an open society to a walled fortress \\u2026 has not been curbed by the killing of Osama bin Laden.\\u201d\\u00a0 The U.S., and indeed much of the western world, has succumbed to the fear of terror, \\u201creinforced by the network of independent terrorism analysts that has grown up around the global war on terror \\u2026 by consistently warning that America is under siege [they] have built a cottage industry out of fear.\\u201dTerror is used as a political strength.\\u00a0 \\u201cIn the White House and Congress \\u2026 American leaders have learned that keeping the terrorist threat alive provides enormous political benefits.\\u201d\\u00a0 It is also used to create wealth for those in power and connected to power, \\u201cFear sustains the multibillion dollar security industry through both Republican and Democratic administrations.\\u201dThis fear factor carries over into the final chapter, \\u201cThe War on Truth,\\u201d which discusses the burgeoning role of the NSA and cyber security.\\u00a0 It is \\u201cthe story of the people who tried to stop the NSA\\u2019s domestic spying program \\u2026 in the face of money, power, and greed.\\u00a0\\u00a0 It is also the story of how government secrecy\\u2014and a crackdown on whistleblowers\\u2014has enabled the worst excesses of the post 9\\/11 era to go unchecked, from torture to data mining on a massive scale.\\u00a0 Secrecy has enabled a new class of national security entrepreneurs and wild freebooters.\\u00a0 Secrecy breeds corruption.\\u201dSecrecy, greed, and corruption go together, \\u201cgovernment secrecy has prevented the public from understanding the true nature of the cyber threat or knowing the full extent of the government\\u2019s intrusions into their online privacy in the name of cybersecurity.\\u201d\\u00a0\\u00a0 There is, as per Edward Snowden, \\u201clittle real difference between cybersecurity and domestic surveillance.\\u201dThere is now a whole new cybersecurity industrial complex, one which is also used offensively, as \\u201cthe NSA is now one of the world\\u2019s leaders in the use of offensive cyberattacks,\\u201d and \\u201chas been behind some of the most sophisticated and damaging cyberattacks ever mounted,\\u201d\\u2014except of course for those we do not hear about, either from the U.S.\\/Israel side, or the \\u2018other\\u2014evil\\u2019 side.In closing, Risen says that his response to both the government\\u2019s campaign against him and to the endless wars and endless fear factors is the writing of Pay Any Price.\\u00a0 It is his answer as \\u201cto how best challenge the government\\u2019s draconian efforts to crack down on aggressive investigative journalism and suppress the truth in the name of ceaseless war.\\u201dRisen\\u2019s writing is clear and concise.\\u00a0 He notes when certain personnel have refused comment on a particular subject, and has kept some of his sources at their request, from being named.\\u00a0 The information he provides is well referenced and he uses outside indicators to support his anecdotal material.\\u00a0\\u00a0 It is an enlightening read for the individual stories that are told, and for the repercussions that the global war on terror, and its associated\\u00a0 power, greed, and secrecy has had on our daily lives.Note[1] Two books well worth reading concerning torture, its history, applications and illegalities:Philippe Sands, Torture Team: Deception, Cruelty and the Compromise of Law (New York: Allen Lane, 2008).Alfred W.

In 2014, it enjoyed the biggest IPO in Israeli history, raising about $1B at a market capitalization of $5.3B (last time I checked, the market cap was close 10B). That might modest here, in Silicon Valley. But in Israel, the impact is huge. And not just in terms in dollars. They are an inspiration to many start-ups in Start-up Nation who until last year could only imagine smaller exits. But it\\u2019s also about the tech: Mobileye has developed a unique set of technologies that assist drivers by warning them of potential collisions and recommending moves to mitigate risk. \\nThe key word is assist. When I met with leaders of the company \\u2013 as part of a recent delegation to Israel \\u2013 their elevator pitch was not only crisp but nicely focused on the idea that the company was in the business of building \\u201cdriver assistance systems.\\u201d Working with car manufacturers, they are also part of a future market whose narrative has been hijacked by visions of driverless cars. But the way Mobileye has been telling its story, the narrative has a more human element. We may look to the future not just as a place where technology does the driving for us, but where technology may in fact make us better drivers. \\nAdding a human element to the narrative about the future of driving is a good thing. The narrative today is creepy, and may not be effective with consumers (it robs people of their sense of agency; machines, not humans, will be in control). The new narrative could also be good for expanding the market for the future of driving. At a time when a broad set of technologies are accelerating so quickly that we fear them, we can be thinking about markets that will grow by putting these technologies to empower people, not disenfranchise them. \\nIn other words, there may soon be a bigger market for \\u201cassistive technologies.\\u201d And in Israel, we\\u2019re beginning to see what might very well become a new market for assistive vision technologies. Directly after we spoke with the Mobileye execs, we met with one of the founders of Orcam, a company that has developed a wearable device \\u201cdesigned to assist people who are visually impaired\\u201d (emphasis added). Amnon Shashua, co-founder of Mobileye is also a co-founder of Orcam. And while the technologies and use cases are different, the orientation toward human experience is consistent. \\nThey might also inspire more innovation of this kind. Just as Israel has developed ecosystems for tech categories like cyber security (the subject of an article I posted several weeks ago) and agriculture, the subject of an article I plan to post later), Israel might develop a rich ecosystem for a broader range of assistive technologies and medical devices. I got peek into that world during my visit to the MEDinISRAEL\\u00a0conference. But after I returned to the states, I heard directly from a company called RayGo that\\u2019s running a thus-far successful Indiegogo campaign to deliver a device you clamp onto your steering wheel that enables you to more safely respond to incoming messages on your mobile apps. The company, which developed \\u201ceye-free patented technology created for the blind,\\u201d sees an opportunity to assist consumers with the future of driving, Mobileye\\u2019s market. \\nWill we see more tech like this coming out of Israel? If yes, it could be good for entrepreneurs, good for the nation \\u2013 it is still growing, and it can and should be known for more than its prowess in cyber security \\u2013 and good for all of us. The narrative should not be \\u201cman versus machine,\\u201d but rather \\u201cmachine at the service of man.\\u201d \\u00a0That\\u2019s could be the meta-narrative for all future technology development. \\u00a0Let\\u2019s see how well Israeli entrepreneurs can get behind it. \\n\\n \\n Source: Mobileye video\\n \\n\\u00a0 \\n\\u00a0 \\n\\u00a0 \\n\\u00a0\\n\\n\\n\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\n\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\",\n                \"source\": \"www.forbes.com\",\n                \"publishDate\": \"2015-04-19T22:34:00+02:00\",\n                \"sourceType\": \"web\",\n                \"language\": \"en\",\n                \"googleRank\": 8,\n                \"relatedDocs\": [\n\n                ]\n            },\n            {\n                \"id\": 186612151,\n                \"url\": \"http:\\/\\/palashbiswaslive.blogspot.com\\/2015\\/04\\/the-khazarian-mafia-plotting-another-911.html\",\n                \"title\": \"After the 9\\/11 attack, Benjamin Netanyahu was elated.

Based on what he said publicly, he probably went to a party on the same day to celebrate the ideological paradigm shift which happened shortly after the buildings went down. He probably knew that the disastrous event was going to bring about some kind of\\u00a0tikkum olam. The mad man was so happy that he could not hide his feelings. During a conference at Bar-Ilan University, he said:\\\"We are benefiting from one thing, and that is the attack on the Twin Towers and Pentagon, and the American struggle in Iraq.\\\"[1]All of those diabolical events, Netanyahu continued to say, \\\"swung American public opinion in our favor.\\\"[2]Phew! When your sons and daughters and loved ones died at the World Trade Center, it was a victory for Netanyahu. What he ended up saying was that no price is too high for the Israeli regime. He also ended up saying that because of the 9\\/11 attack, the Israeli regime could grab Washington and much of America by the balls and squeeze them.Much of America, indeed, did not pay close attention to what the mad man in Tel Aviv was actually saying because the \\\"Khazarian Mafia\\\" had already saturated the culture with the message that Netanyahu was some kind of a savior who will bring world peace, crush terrorism, and promote \\\"democracy and freedom\\\" in the Middle East.For example, Sean Hannity cannot function without quoting Netanyahu approvingly with respect to issues in the Middle East:https:\\/\\/www.youtube.com\\/watch?feature=player_embedded&amp;v=qTqHqYEjqWEHad the vast majority of Americans known about the diabolical work of the psychopath in Tel Aviv, they would have almost certainly chanted that America needs to send the regime back into the dark ages.The Zionist media indeed knew that there would have been an uproar if they did not bombard Americans with fake news day in and day out. To suppress serious research, the Zionist media quickly began to label people who began to examine the 9\\/11 attack \\\"conspiracy nuts.\\\" But politicians in the Middle East were not that blind. Former Iran's President Mahmoud Ahmadinejad declared then,\\\"Four or five years ago, a suspicious event occurred in New York. A building collapsed and they said that 3,000 people had been killed but never published their names. Under this pretext, they [the U.S.] attacked Afghanistan and Iraq and since then, a million people have been killed only in Iraq.\\\"[3]Netanyahu, of course, did not like Ahmadinejad's statement. As the saying goes, truth always hurts, particularly when you don't like it. Ahmadinejad, according to Netanyahu, was Adolf Hitler in a physical body.\\\"Where that [Nazi] regime embarked on a global conflict before it developed nuclear weapons,\\\" he said, \\\"This regime [Iran] is developing nuclear weapons before it embarks on a global conflict.\\\"[4]Ahmadinejad has been out of office since 2013 and Iran still doesn't have the bomb. In other words, the mad man in Tel Aviv continues to lie. But puppets like Sean Hannity never got the memo.The question that we should all ask is this: If the Israeli regime gets another chance, or if they think that another 9\\/11 would swing \\\"American public opinion in our favor,\\\" would they do it? Listen to Col. (res.) Dr. Gabi Siboni, director of the Cyber Security Program at the Institute for National Security Studies (INSS) inTel Aviv, and try to read between the line here:\\\"The disruption and possible infiltration of critical infrastructure is the most severe form of cyber attack. Such attacks on airplanes or air traffic control towers, for instance, means that hackers could cause accidents, or even paralyze entire flight systems.\\\"As of now, this area of capabilities is the exclusive domain of developed states. I strongly believe however, that the next 9\\/11 will happen without suicide bombers aboard the plane with box-cutters but will occur because of a cyber incident perpetrated by a terror organization.\\\"[5]Which terror organization? And why would Siboni even entertain that thought when he does not give us concrete evidence of the so-called terrorist organization?Furthermore, does Siboni mean to tell us that \\\"ISIS\\\" or \\\"Al-Qaeda\\\" or the Syrian rebels\\/terrorists have enough technological devices or lucrative and political power to do this highly sophisticated act of terrorism? If so, then the so-called \\\"Jewish genius\\\" as propounded by people like Charles Murray[6]\\u00a0needs revision. Members of \\\"Al-Qaeda\\\" out-think the Dreadful Few?The next frightening thought is this: What if Siboni's assessment is a perverse way of saying that the Israeli regime does have enough technological leverage to create another 9\\/11? Is this far-fetched? Once again, perhaps we need to bring in Israeli military historian Martin van Cleveld:\\\"We possess several hundred atomic warheads and rockets and can launch them at targets in all directions, perhaps even at Rome. Most European capitals are targets for our air force.\\\"Let me quote General Moshe Dayan: 'Israel must be like a mad dog, too dangerous to bother.'\\\"I consider it all hopeless at this point. We shall have to try to prevent things from coming to that, if at all possible. Our armed forces, however, are not the thirtieth strongest in the world, but rather the second or third.\\\"We have the capability to take the world down with us. And I can assure you that that will happen before Israel goes under.\\\"[7]\\u00a0https:\\/\\/www.youtube.com\\/watch?feature=player_embedded&amp;v=JWpWc_suPWoAnother issue\\u00a0that needs further exploration is that if Siboni is really worrying about cyber attacks, shouldn't he explain to us that it was the Israel regime that created cyber attacks? For example Stutxnet, the virus which actually created panic in Iran, was the invention of the NSA and the Israel.[8]What Siboni is telling us here is that the real joker in this discussion is certainly the Israeli regime. \\\"Israeli industry is coming to show its technology,\\\" he said.\\u00a0\\\"Israeli companies and American companies are real business partners.\\\"[9]Netanyahu, back in 2014, put the issue into proper perspective when he said, \\\"We are in a new world. We are preparing with new forces.\\\"[10]Here Netanyahu was not specifically talking about literal guns and bullets. He was postulating that in this \\\"new world\\\"\\u2014and Yuri Slezkine would have called it \\\"The Jewish Century\\\"\\u2014psychological warfare must be used to divert important issues, to confuse enemies, and to postulate lies if necessary if necessary.This became very clear when Netanyahu again declared, \\\"Iran and its proxies take advantage of the security and anonymity of cyberspace.\\\"[11]About two days ago,\\u00a0Netanyahu\\u00a0twitted:\\\"Just as the Nazis aspired to crush civilization and to establish a 'master race' as ruler of the world while annihilating the Jewish people, o too does Iran strive to gain control over the region and then spread further, with the explicit intent of obliterating the Jewish state.\\\"How dumb can this be? Isn't it the Israeli regime that constantly attacks Iran? Wasn't it the same regime that assassinated Iranian scientists? Listen to this admission by a U.S. official, followed by other testimonies:https:\\/\\/www.youtube.com\\/watch?feature=player_embedded&amp;v=n8bRSt5SK5Ehttps:\\/\\/www.youtube.com\\/watch?feature=player_embedded&amp;v=_VHjtv9A1VQhttps:\\/\\/www.youtube.com\\/watch?feature=player_embedded&amp;v=SkZQiOlHBzgAll of this has been corroborated by Israeli writers.[12]\\u00a0Again, who is really the joker in this political discussion? Iran?The answer is no. The Dreadful Few are part of the problem. AsPreston James and Mike Harris\\u00a0have recently put it,\\\"Jesus drove them out of the temple for their evil, anti-social inhuman ways and we must do the same before they mass-murder us all like they did to the Russian Peasants in 1917 and are systematically and progressively doing so to the Palestinians while they steal more and more of their ancestral lands.\\\"It is past time that we bring those \\\"Khazarian\\\" evildoers to court and charge them for their criminal activity. It is also time that we charge those who forged alliance with them.

Once again, perhaps we need to bring in Israeli military historian Martin van Cleveld:\\\"We possess several hundred atomic warheads and rockets and can launch them at targets in all directions, perhaps even at Rome. Most European capitals are targets for our air force.\\\"Let me quote General Moshe Dayan: 'Israel must be like a mad dog, too dangerous to bother.'\\\"I consider it all hopeless at this point. We shall have to try to prevent things from coming to that, if at all possible. Our armed forces, however, are not the thirtieth strongest in the world, but rather the second or third.\\\"We have the capability to take the world down with us. And I can assure you that that will happen before Israel goes under.\\\"[7]\\u00a0https:\\/\\/www.youtube.com\\/watch?feature=player_embedded&amp;v=JWpWc_suPWoAnother issue\\u00a0that needs further exploration is that if Siboni is really worrying about cyber attacks, shouldn't he explain to us that it was the Israel regime that created cyber attacks? For example Stutxnet, the virus which actually created panic in Iran, was the invention of the NSA and the Israel.[8]What Siboni is telling us here is that the real joker in this discussion is certainly the Israeli regime. \\\"Israeli industry is coming to show its technology,\\\" he said.\\u00a0\\\"Israeli companies and American companies are real business partners.\\\"[9]Netanyahu, back in 2014, put the issue into proper perspective when he said, \\\"We are in a new world. We are preparing with new forces.\\\"[10]Here Netanyahu was not specifically talking about literal guns and bullets. He was postulating that in this \\\"new world\\\"\\u2014and Yuri Slezkine would have called it \\\"The Jewish Century\\\"\\u2014psychological warfare must be used to divert important issues, to confuse enemies, and to postulate lies if necessary if necessary.This became very clear when Netanyahu again declared, \\\"Iran and its proxies take advantage of the security and anonymity of cyberspace.\\\"[11]About two days ago,\\u00a0Netanyahu\\u00a0twitted:\\\"Just as the Nazis aspired to crush civilization and to establish a 'master race' as ruler of the world while annihilating the Jewish people, o too does Iran strive to gain control over the region and then spread further, with the explicit intent of obliterating the Jewish state.\\\"How dumb can this be? Isn't it the Israeli regime that constantly attacks Iran? Wasn't it the same regime that assassinated Iranian scientists? Listen to this admission by a U.S. official, followed by other testimonies:https:\\/\\/www.youtube.com\\/watch?feature=player_embedded&amp;v=n8bRSt5SK5Ehttps:\\/\\/www.youtube.com\\/watch?feature=player_embedded&amp;v=_VHjtv9A1VQhttps:\\/\\/www.youtube.com\\/watch?feature=player_embedded&amp;v=SkZQiOlHBzgAll of this has been corroborated by Israeli writers.[12]\\u00a0Again, who is really the joker in this political discussion? Iran?The answer is no. The Dreadful Few are part of the problem. AsPreston James and Mike Harris\\u00a0have recently put it,\\\"Jesus drove them out of the temple for their evil, anti-social inhuman ways and we must do the same before they mass-murder us all like they did to the Russian Peasants in 1917 and are systematically and progressively doing so to the Palestinians while they steal more and more of their ancestral lands.\\\"It is past time that we bring those \\\"Khazarian\\\" evildoers to court and charge them for their criminal activity. It is also time that we charge those who forged alliance with them. I am thinking of people like Bush, Rice, Cheney and others.https:\\/\\/www.youtube.com\\/watch?feature=player_embedded&amp;v=-_8ckfGaNKYhttps:\\/\\/www.youtube.com\\/watch?feature=player_embedded&amp;v=68_3rjp0Rkw[1]\\u00a0\\\"Report: Netanyahu says 9\\/11 terror attacks good for Israel,\\\"Haaretz, April 16, 2008.[2]\\u00a0Ibid.[3]\\u00a0Ibid.[4]\\u00a0Ibid.[5]\\u00a0Quoted in Yaakov Lappin, \\\"Hackers have 'begun targeting nuclear power plants,' cyber warfare expert warns,\\\"\\u00a0Jerusalem Post, April 16, 2015.[6]\\u00a0Charles Murray, \\\"Jewish Genius,\\\"\\u00a0Commentary, April 1, 2007.[7]\\u00a0Quoted in \\\"The War Game,\\\"\\u00a0Guardian, September 21, 2003.[8]\\u00a0\\\"Leaker Snowden says Israel, US created Stuxnet virus,\\\"\\u00a0Times of Israel, July 8, 2013;\\u00a0\\u00a0William J.

Eschelbeck gave his two cents on the issue of user privacy being compromised at times as a result of companies like Google ramping up their security.&#13;\\nEschelbeck says otherwise, noting that \\\"security and privacy\\\" go hand in hand instead of in opposing streams. He describes privacy in the same light as security, deeming it as a user\\u2019s right to protect his or her personal information from being displayed on the internet without consent. Eschelbeck adds that Google has been making increased efforts to \\\"double down\\\" on privacy. He aims to bring in increased security to the internet telling AFP, \\\"I hope for a time when all the traffic on the Internet is encrypted.\\\" Eschelbeck is certain that by 2018 users will be subject to a great number of checks aside from the typical password.&#13;\\nLast year Google was scrutinized by for breaching people\\u2019s privacy. The company was accused of wrongfully putting up certain bits of information that a user prefers to keep private. Accordingly a Spanish citizen filled a case against Google wherein he demanded that the company take down a photo of his repossessed home from its search results. EU\\u2019s Court of Justice subsequently ordered Google to delist or take down links to old \\u2018irrelevant \\u2018information on special request. Google meanwhile expressed disappointment over this arguing that this act was sheer censorship.&#13;\\nGerhard Eschelbeck joined Google as its security chief earlier this year. During his interview he expressed great excitement over the prospect of managing online security on such a large scale. Considering that the search engine giant has a plethora of products, it could face cyber attacks on several fronts. This however also means that Google\\u2019s security experts use advanced technological equipment to tackle these attacks.&#13;\\nEschelbeck has been involved with cyber security for almost 20 years, with the majority of that time being spent at computer security pioneer McAfee. He has also worked with a variety of tech companies as a consultant owns a lot of network security patents. During his longstanding career he has come across a diverse range of issues with regards to security.&#13;\\nGoogle\\u2019s new sheriff however believes that online security technology has to be constantly updated as new types of threats appear from time to time. Saying that as a \\\"security guy\\\" he is \\\"never comfortable\\\", Eschelbeck however assures that his team is highly capable of dealing with all sorts of attacks.

This exam, globally launched at the Cyber Security Week in The Hague in The Netherlands, builds on the recently launched EXIN Secure Programming certification.Estimates of current annual cost to the global economy from cybercrime range between $375 and $575 billion, according to a recent study published by McAfee.* The worldwide cyber security market on the other hand is an emerging market and expected to grow from $71 billion in 2014 to $155+ billion by 2019, according to the latest forecast from Gartner, Inc.\\nAs worldwide cyber security threats and the global cyber security services market are on the rise, EXIN experiences a growing demand for certifications in the field of cyber security related subjects. Anticipating this trend EXIN recently launched its Security Framework \\u2013 a certification cluster with an expanding portfolio of cyber security exams such as Ethical hacking.\\nThe global availability of the EXIN Ethical Hacking Foundation certification means IT professionals are provided with a vendor-neutral Ethical Hacking competence confirmation, from an internationally acknowledged certification institute. The new exam tests IT professionals on basic knowledge and understanding of \\u201cEthical Hacking\\u201d \\u2013 the ability to evaluate IT security systems by exploiting hardware and software vulnerabilities using hacking techniques. Ethical hacking is a well-known method of duplicating the intent and actions of malicious hackers, also known as black hats, used by security professionals, the white hats, to locate and evaluate infrastructural weaknesses.\\nThe EXIN Ethical Hacking Foundation certification covers a variety of hacking related subjects and techniques, including network traffic analyzing, wireless network hacking, network scanning and the penetration of computer systems and websites.\\nMore in detail, candidates are tested on their knowledge and understanding with regards to (but not limited to) the following topics:\\n\\u2022 Network sniffing (gathering information from network traffic)\\n\\u2022 Cracking a WPA(2) key from a wireless network\\n\\u2022 An introduction to worms and botnets\\n\\u2022 Network vulnerability scanning\\n\\u2022 Basic penetration of computer systems\\n\\u2022 Password cracking\\n\\u2022 Web-based hacking, containing SQL Injections (SQLi), Cross-Site Scripting (XSS), Remote File Inclusions (RFI)\\n\\u2022 Analyzing log files\\n\\u201cEthical Hacking Foundation is another proof of EXIN\\u2019s ability to deliver the right IT certifications at the right time,\\u201d said Bernd Taselaar, CEO of EXIN. \\u201cCyber-Security will remain a hot topic in 2015 and beyond. We already had the management focused Information Security based on ISO\\/IEC 27002 certification. Next to that, the expanding Security Framework now caters to the growing security certification needs of IT professionals like programmers and developers. EXIN sees a strong market demand for high-quality IT security certifications. The e-CF principles incorporated in EXIN\\u2019s exams ensure that the certifications live up to market expectations.\\u201d\\nRecently launched within the Security Framework is EXIN Secure Programming Foundation, a certification for software developers and programmers who want to have their skills in Building Security In validated. EXIN Ethical Hacking Foundation builds on the Secure Programming certification, by adding risk assessment within application and web development to EXIN\\u2019s certification portfolio.The new certification, based on the e-Competence Framework (e-CF)** will initially be made available in English, with language localizations in a variety of global markets following soon. The exam is available through EXIN\\u2019s partner channel and EXIN Anywhere in more than 165 countries worldwide.\\nThe EXIN Ethical Hacking Foundation and EXIN Secure Programming certifications are developed in joint cooperation with Security Academy, a European training institute with its focus on Information Security, Business Continuity Management (BCM) and Security Management. The partnership with Security Academy is meant to combine hands-on, practical and job-oriented ICT security experience with EXIN\\u2019s vendor independent IT certification knowledge base, both at a high international level.\\nLike this:Like Loading...\\n\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t \\t\\tThis entry was posted on Sunday, 19 April 2015 at 11:22\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\tand is filed under Economia, Estero, Recensioni.\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\tTagged: certification, exin, expands, security. \\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\tYou can follow any responses to this entry through the RSS 2.0 feed.\\n\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\tYou can leave a response, or trackback from your own site.\\n\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\n\\n\\t\\n\\n\\t\\t\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\",\n                \"source\": \"fidest.wordpress.com\",\n                \"publishDate\": \"2015-04-19T11:22:29+02:00\",\n                \"sourceType\": \"blog\",\n                \"language\": \"en\",\n                \"googleRank\": 3,\n                \"relatedDocs\": [\n\n                ]\n            },\n            {\n                \"id\": 186521698,\n                \"url\": \"http:\\/\\/www.gulf-times.com\\/qatar\\/178\\/details\\/435549\\/%e2%80%98protecting-critical-infrastructure-key-to-qatar%e2%80%99s-cyber-security-approach%e2%80%99\",\n                \"title\": \"Protecting critical infrastructure has always been a prime objective of Qatar\\u2019s cyber security approach, HE the Minister of Information and Communications Technology Dr Hessa al-Jaber has said.\\u201cWe sta\",\n                \"content\": \"Protecting critical infrastructure has always been a prime objective of Qatar\\u2019s cyber security approach, HE the Minister of Information and Communications Technology Dr Hessa al-Jaber has said.\\u201cWe started early with the establishment of the region\\u2019s first CERT in 2008.

Governments should reinforce the mechanisms that promote transparency and open data access.With regard to social and economic growth, she said Qatar had created an environment that fostered ICT innovation through the development of proper legal framework and skills.\\u201cOur cyber safety and digital literacy programme is embedded in the early stages of our education system, while also providing Internet access and ICT training to minority groups and the labour workforce. We have also issued various policies and regulations in line with international treaties and practices such as the 2014 cybercrime law, policies to ensure open data and transparency, and a law on personal information privacy protection will be released soon,\\u201d HE Dr al-Jaber noted.The Internet, she said, must become more resilient across nations.\\u201cWe applaud the concerted efforts of the ITU and ICANN in this regard. International co-ordination should continue in helping bridging the digital divide between nations. Governments should harmonise their jurisdictions in cyberspace through UN initiatives,\\u201d she added.HE the Minister also urged public authorities to work closely with private sectors and civil societies by engaging in open discussions, sharing information and developing public-private partnerships to enhance the protection of nations\\u2019 critical assets.Governments, she said, should build a common understanding of threats through norms and standards. Establishing a common cyber risk information exchange framework between nations will help address the challenges of predictability of cyber threats.\\u201cQatar is supporting the UN reports highlighted by the Seoul framework, which can serve as a basis to develop such an information-sharing model,\\u201d she stressed.&#13;\\n                        \",\n                \"source\": \"www.gulf-times.com\",\n                \"publishDate\": \"2015-04-19T07:53:15.665+02:00\",\n                \"sourceType\": \"web\",\n                \"language\": \"en\",\n                \"googleRank\": 7,\n                \"relatedDocs\": [\n\n                ]\n            },\n            {\n                \"id\": 186507302,\n                \"url\": \"http:\\/\\/www.moroccoworldnews.com\\/2014\\/04\\/129412\\/karima-rhanem-only-moroccan-to-take-part-in-model-united-nations-in-the-balkan\\/\",\n                \"title\": \"&#13;\\n   \\t\\t\\t\\t            \\t    &#13;\\n                &#13;\\n\\t    &#13;\\n        \\t\\t\\t&#13;\\n        \\nRabat \\u2013 Moroccan young leader Karima Rhanem will take part in the largest Model United Nations in the Bal\",\n                \"content\": \"&#13;\\n   \\t\\t\\t\\t            \\t    &#13;\\n                &#13;\\n\\t    &#13;\\n        \\t\\t\\t&#13;\\n        \\nRabat \\u2013 Moroccan young leader Karima Rhanem will take part in the largest Model United Nations in the Balkan scheduled to take place in Albania on\\u00a0May 2-5. \\nMs. Rhanem will be the only\\u00a0\\u00a0guest speaker from Morocco for the opening of the conference and a chair of the simulation of the United Nations General Assembly Disarmament and International security committee (DISEC).\\n\\u201cI am very honored to have been selected by the Balkan Model United Nations Secretariat to open the conference among other national and international personalities.

It was really hard for me in the beginning. However, once past that stage, things got so much better and I now thoroughly enjoy myself here,\\u201d he said.Tun Muhammad said not all culture shocks were negative, adding that some were actually pleasant discoveries.\\u201cThe people I met here \\u2014 local or foreigners \\u2014 are very friendly and helpful. They are not shy to greet you with a smile. I was \\u2018shocked\\u2019 by their friendliness and eagerness to help. After a while, their friendliness made me feel I am not a stranger here. And I also started greeting everyone with a smile. Their friendliness is contagious,\\u201d he said enthusiastically.He also noted that most Kiwi drivers are very polite.\\u201cThey give way to pedestrians instead of the other way round. The police are strict but very helpful and efficient. What has impressed me most is the cleanliness here. Most places are so clean that people can go barefoot everywhere \\u2013 something they do a lot of during summer on campus and other recreational places such as the beach.\\u201dA Mara-sponsored student, Tun Muhammad has been allocated NZ$1,100 per week for living expenses. However, as the cost of living in Waikato is one of the cheapest in NZ, he only has to pay NZ$70 for rental.He has been saving his weekly allowance for a flight ticket back to Malaysia every long holiday. During the university term, he goes shopping for groceries, among other necessities, and visiting friends on weekends.Since coming to NZ, this outdoors-loving Malaysian student has taken up hiking and fishing, going to the beach and skiing. Life has been good with the pristine mountains being only three hours away and the beach, even nearer.It is, thus, quite understandable that he now plans to stay on to do his Master\\u2019s at the same university.Malaysian students\\u2019 associations in NZFor fellowship and help, Malaysian students such as Tun Muhammad can always turn to the Malaysian students\\u2019 associations across New Zealand \\u2013 apart from university staff.When the Education New Zealand (ENZ) media team was invited to attend Orientation Day organised by the Otago Malaysian Students\\u2019 Association (Omsa), on March 7, it was quite a surprise to see the big hall packed with hundreds of Malaysians.It was even more impressive that Omsa was able to prepare some authentic Malaysian dishes and drinks \\u2014 Sarawak laksa and roti canai to go with either teh tarik or yam jelly.Omsa president Cheah Seng Wei, 24, a fourth-year Pharmacy student, said the association was set up in 1963.The purpose was to bring Malaysian students together, help new Malaysian students adapt and organise activities not only to make student-life in NZ more interesting but also to introduce Malaysian culture to non-Malaysians.Activities for the rest of the year include Malam Malaysia showcasing the diverse cultures of Malaysia, Malaysian Carnival and a trip to Quarantine Island.\\u201cWe\\u2019re doing all this for one main purpose \\u2014 to bring home closer to Malaysians studying in NZ,\\u201d Cheah said.Khor Sze Yuin, a third-year marketing student at the University of Canterbury, shared that when she first landed in Christchurch at 5am, it was members of the Christchurch Malaysian Students\\u2019 Association who came to meet her and help her settle in.Auckland University of Technology (AUT) student Samantha Hiew, who is cultural officer of the Auckland Malaysian Students\\u2019 Association, said there are seven such associations in the eight NZ universities.Meetings have been held for the biggest Malaysian event in NZ \\u2014 the Bersatu Games, an annual sports event where various competitions such as rugby, badminton, tennis, table tennis, football and futsal are held. For this year, there will also be a debating contest.Hiew, a third year law student, said through these games, Malaysians in NZ could come together to have a good time, and many Malaysian students actually flew to the game\\u2019s venue to participate.With a strong theme statement \\u2014 \\u2018Sail to Glory\\u2019 \\u2014 it is not surprising the Bersatu Games sees tough competition and a strong spirit among the participants.As a green country, NZ\\u2019s bins separate recyclables and organic waste.University of WaikatoLocated in the river city of Hamilton, the university is known for its beautiful 65ha campus with three ornamental lakes.Established in 1964, it is well-known as a modern and innovative university. Its academic success has placed it among the top 2 per cent of the 17,000 universities in the world, according to the European Universities\\u2019 Association \\u2014 with more than 90 per cent of its academic staff being research-active.In terms of subjects, it now has five ranked in the top 150 in the world. Its education programme has been ranked 46th in the world by the QS Subject Rankings last year while its modern languages, economics and econometrics, law and computer science and info systems were all ranked between 101 and 150.In view of growing global demand for skilled cyber security professionals at 3.5 times the pace of the overall job market, the university is the first in New Zealand to offer a Master\\u2019s degree in cyber security that trains new security professionals as well as retrains existing computer science and IT professionals to be cyber security specialists.The Master of Cyber Security course covers the technical, legal and management aspects of cyber security and addresses new topics as they emerge in cyberspace.Cyber Security Lab senior lecturer and head Dr Ryan Ko explained that the Computing and Mathematical Sciences Faculty and US\\u2019 National Aeronautics and Space Administration (Nasa) started Internet connection in New Zealand on the campus in 1989.\\u201cOur Machine Learning-Data Mining groups are world-renowned. A prominent tool used worldwide is Weka with more than three million downloads. Then, there\\u2019s the world-renowned Digital Library research group whose Greenstone Digital Library software is used in more than 60 countries,\\u201d said Ko of several of the faculty\\u2019s achievements.With alumni including big names such as Google engineering director Dr Graig Nevill-Manning and Academy Award winner John Allitt (special effects for \\u2018The Lord of The Rings\\u2019, \\u2018The Hobbit\\u2019 and \\u2018Avatar\\u2019) and a long history of winning student competitions, the faculty which has a strong applied research culture and entrepreneurial mindset is the platform for students serious about exploring cyber space.As a cyber security expert with full awareness that the skills learnt may be abused, Ko has a clear idea of where to start the cyber programmes.\\u201cWe start our courses with the teaching of ethics to lay a good foundation for our students.\\u201dBelieving strongly the world needs a software that returns control of data back to the users in view of easy data excess to hackers, apart from adopting \\u2018Return Control\\u2019 as the lab\\u2019s motto, Ko is also in the midst of developing software to allow individuals to tighten their own cyber security.Victoria UniversityKnown for its scenic hills, deep blue sea and safety, the city of Wellington is compact with every part of the city centre reachable on foot. It is a city free of traffic jams, pollution and population pressures. Though the capital city of NZ, Wellington comes across as affordable and convenient.Victoria University was chosen by the NZ government as the top university for research in 2013.Its law faculty has been named the leading law school in the country. Other specialities include foreign languages and linguistics, human geography, pure and applied mathematics, Maori knowledge and development, molecular, cellular and whole organism biology, philosophy and statistics.Globally, Victoria has been ranked among the world\\u2019s top 150 universities by the QS Subject Rankings last year in 11 subjects, including law, arts and social sciences, psychology, earth sciences and information technology. Its Business School is among the global elite group of 60 given the triple crown of international commerce accreditations.Of its total 22,000 students, 14 per cent are international students, and Victoria Business School (VBS), situated close to crucial government buildings, including the Beehive, the executive arm of NZ\\u2019s parliament, is one of the most popular in attracting foreign students.Prof John Davies said VBS\\u2019 location is self-explanatory in terms of relevance as close proximity to decision-making government departments means the school\\u2019s strength lies in the fact that it is recognised and accredited by international academic bodies or business professional associations.One-sixth of VBS students are international students with Malaysians being the third largest group after Chinese nationals and Vietnamese.Next year VBS will welcome another batch of 150 Malaysian students mainly from Kolej Yayasan Saad. The young Malaysians have just finished their foundation year at the University of Auckland and the University of Canterbury.\\u201cVBS\\u2019 partnership with overseas counterparts has not only helped enrich the cultures of NZ students but at the same time, the school is able to help produce significant numbers of qualified accountants for overseas countries such as Malaysia,\\u201d Davies said.Ko (centre) is seen at the Cyber Security Lab.Massey UniversityMassey University started off as Massey Agriculture College in 1927, and was upgraded to university status in 1964. With its roots in agriculture and food, the university has over the years earned its place as an authority in this field.In terms of agriculture, it is ranked the top in the country and 19th in the world.This state-funded university with its 80 years of tradition has also proven itself through academic excellence and outstanding performance.Housing 32,449 students, of whom some 15,000 are long distance learners and about 4,000 international students, the university has consistently been placed by QS World University Ranking in the top 3 per cent of universities in the world.Apart from agriculture, it leads the world in courses such as food technology, veterinary medicine, aviation, biotechnology, volcanology, communication and media studies, defence, accounting and finance.It is the only NZ university with a veterinary teaching hospital and the only university offering a degree in aviation.Renowned for its world-class research and achievements as the world leader in distance education, the university has international collaboration with tertiary institutions globally with 218 active international partnership agreements.Vice-chancellor Steve Maharey said the university has embraced change both from within and in the wider world to meet new needs.While continuing to build up its traditional strengths, the university also initiates new and diverse efforts to address upcoming issues such as food security.\\u201cLast century, the world faced the issue of producing more food. This has become more pressing now as food security is at the top on the agenda for most governments worldwide.\\u201cOn top of that, there is the issue of food safety, which was not so much of an issue in the last century. Sustainability of production and environmental issues have become extremely important. There are now issues of traceability and use of IT to support the food industry,\\u201d said Maharey, who is a former education minister.With agriculture and food being the university\\u2019s forte, Maharey said Massey University has much to contribute to the world in these areas as any research outcomes or new findings would not only benefit NZ but also other countries.He also highlighted the university\\u2019s efforts to find new business and economic approaches, given that the present economic model, built by the west, has been suffering from economic crises every 10 years.The university is also pushing the boundary in scientific research, and endeavouring to maintain its leading position in areas such as communications, engineering and advanced technology.To cater for the needs of Muslim students across the world, Massey University has set up an Islamic Centre by the lakeside on its main campus at Palmerston North.The project built with the grants sponsored by the Sabahan government, was initiated by a Malaysian \\u2014 Associate Prof Alex Chu \\u2014 who was also a former Massey lecturer.ConclusionElijah Wood, the lead actor of \\u2018The Lord of the Rings\\u2019 trilogy once said: \\u201cThere\\u2019s a real purity in New Zealand that does not exist in the US. It is actually not an easy thing to find in our world any more. It\\u2019s a unique place because it is so far away from the rest of the world. There is a sense of isolation and also being protected.\\u201dWood was quite right.Situated in the far south, away from the rest of the world, NZ has been well protected by the Pacific Ocean and has grown into a mature country with style, personality and its own way of doing things.The country can be strange in the eyes of those familiar with other parts of the world but to those preferring natural beauty, simplicity and traditional values, it is a paradise. NZ may be isolated physically but it\\u2019s not alone academically with all its universities establishing partnerships with different educational institutions across the globe.Powered by traditional values of upholding truth, kindness and beauty, there is a general spirit of seeking excellence, which has put all its universities on the list of world-renowned tertiary institutions.For students seeking a unique experience as residents and a world-class qualification, NZ is a country that can offer both.International students will enjoy NZ\\u2019s many scenic gems.\",\n                \"source\": \"www.theborneopost.com\",\n                \"publishDate\": \"2015-04-18T19:52:35.438+02:00\",\n                \"sourceType\": \"blog\",\n                \"language\": \"en\",\n                \"googleRank\": 6,\n                \"relatedDocs\": [\n\n                ]\n            },\n            {\n                \"id\": 186464684,\n                \"url\": \"http:\\/\\/news.windowstorussia.com\\/the-usa-and-china-contradiction-growth-in-security-sphere-in-the-apr.html\",\n                \"title\": \"&#13;\\n&#13;\\nWith Chinese building up comprehensive national power, a variety of contradictions between Beijing and Washington are continuously expanding.

Over the period of more than twenty years of \\u2018unipolar moment\\u2019 existence, the United States of America, having accustomed to their unchallenged dominance in global and regional matters, are not ready to accept the right of another state to \\u2018shape the future of the world\\u2019 on an equal basis with Washington. Washington evermore intends to continue setting the tone of global development, to prescribe remedies for economic prosperity and to dictate rules of \\u2018appropriate\\u2019 behavior to other states both in international and internal domestic affairs, which can\\u2019t but trigger quite understandable irritation and resistance on the part of the strengthening Beijing.\\nContrary to official eloquence of the US and China senior officials, and their public claptrap on strengthening of bilateral cooperation and possible development of \\u2018relations of a new type between the Great Powers\\u2019, in reality there is an increase of rivalry and contradictions in the American-Chinese relations. If at the beginning of XXI century the \\u2018negative\\u2019 agenda included the Taiwan issue, human rights discourse (Tibetan and Uighur issues, the problem of Chinese dissidents, freedom of speech, etc.) and a range of economic problems, then in the last few years in record-breaking time this list of contradictions was supplemented by a range of problems related to the South China and the East China Seas, cyber security issues, freedom of Internet in China, the situation in Hong Kong, and also intensifying rivalry between the two countries in the APR, as well as at other regional venues (the Middle East, Africa, Latin America, etc.).\\nWidening of the spheres of contradictions between the USA and China lends evidence for the thesis on the inevitability of rivalry between a firmly established state \\u2013 global leader and a potential super-power rapidly expanding its might, both of which drastically differ in ideology, value system, political and economic model.\\nIn this relation the augmentation of the American-Chinese contradictions in security sphere in the APR is extremely indicative. The both states which since the beginning of XXI century have boosted their involvement in this region\\u2019s affairs give each other a handle for grounded concern and building up of distrust.\\nBeijing\\u2019s growing discontent and deep concern is related to the US intervention since summer 2010 into territorial disputes in the South China and the East China Seas, to strengthening by Washington of the military alliances and formation of new partner relations in the APR (in particular, Washington\\u2019s \\u2018drawing over to its side\\u2019 of such key Asian countries as Vietnam and Myanmar), to the American policy for China demonization, to the intensification of the US joint exercises in this region, to the US continuing intelligence-gathering activities in close vicinity to China\\u2019s territory. Behind the events in Hong Kong, Beijing also sees the US\\u2019 purposeful activities in accordance with the proven scheme of triggering \\u2018colored\\u2019 revolutions, aimed in this case at destabilization of the situation in China and erosion of the CPC legitimacy. Beijing often interprets the majority of critical situations which China currently faces in its internal and external policy, as a result of measures implemented by Washington to deter China.\\nFor Washington there are also more and more issues for concern in relation to the current situation in the security sphere in the APR. Now it is hard to deny the fact that China becomes a new centre of power and influence in the APR. Chinese defense budget demonstrates sustainable growth in absolute terms (in 2015 defense expenditures will grow by 10.1% compared to 2014 and will amount to USD 142 bn), China\\u2019s war potential is considerably consolidating, operating capabilities of its armed forces keep growing, China\\u2019s push in implementation of its national interests also increases.\\nIncidents with the Chinese and American marine vessels and aircraft standoffs in the water areas around China and aerial domains over them have long become common occurrence. China, upholding the principle of absolute ban for foreign war ships\\u2019 navigation within the 200-mile exclusive economic zone of a coastal state, disturbs the American ships\\u2019 navigation in its exclusive economic zone and sometimes outside it. Yet another incident took place in August 2014, when a Chinese fighter aircraft Su-27 impeded the navigation of an American maritime patrol aircraft P-8 flying at the distance of 145 miles from the Chinese Hainan Island. By contrast with the similar incident which ended up in the plane collision and the death of the Chinese pilot, the August incident was without losses and resulted only in protests on the American part.\\nA peculiar response to the continuing intelligence operations by the American Navy and Air Force in the Chinese exclusive economic zone was introduction by China since 2012 of the practice of conducting military maneuvers within the limits of the US exclusive economic zone, in particular in the area of Guam and Hawaii islands in the Pacific Ocean. Such maneuvers became possible due to enhancement of Chinese armed forces\\u2019 operational capabilities. Increased capabilities of the China\\u2019s fleet to overpass \\u2018the first island chain\\u2019 and enter the Pacific Ocean unhindered were demonstrated in July 2013, when for the first time in history Chinese ships sailed through the La Perouse Strait located between the Sakhalin and Hokkaido islands. At the end of March 2015 another showcase incident took place: for the first time the Chinese Air Force crossed \\u2018the first island chain\\u2019 and held maneuvers in the Western part of the Pacific Ocean. Prospectively, one can predict further expansion of military exercise level and the increase of the number of China\\u2019s maneuvers in the Western part of the Pacific Ocean near the American territory with all that it implies.\\nRapid strengthening of China\\u2019s military power is accompanied by Beijing\\u2019s attempts to spread its control over navigable and air routes in the APR. The creation by China of the air defense identification zone in the East China Sea in November 2013 was the first signal, which caused a massive outcry in the region and an extremely negative response on the part of the USA. The second signal followed at the end of March 2015, when China, without relevant coordination with the interested parties, officially opened a new air route M503, only 8 km away from the West of the Taiwan Strait water parting line. Such proximity of the new air route to transportation corridors of Taiwan, the US long-standing partner in the region, can obstruct both civil and military operations for Taiwan, in particular, affect communication between Taiwan and Taiwan-controlled islands of Kinmen and Matsu.\\nWashington also shows deep concern in view of Beijing\\u2019s spinning-up activities in vindicating its claims for disputed islands and water zones of the South China Sea. In 2014, Beijing designated its new tactics in materialization of territorial claims: China undertakes extraordinary in scale and unprecedented in speed works on the creation of artificial islands in the South China Sea. Over the past year China constructed through sluicing at least five artificial islands. In mid-November 2013, Jane\\u2019s Defense Weekly made public satellite images of the construction of the Jongshu Island that was even then larger, in terms of area, than Taiwan-controlled Itu Aba \\u2013 the largest natural island of the Spratly Islands. In February 2015, the world community\\u2019s attention was drawn to sluicing by China of the Yunsidao Island \\u2013 the largest in the group of the Paracel Islands. Compared to 2013, the island area almost doubled. The construction of new islands and the enlargement of those already existing can considerably strengthen China\\u2019s positions in the South China Sea, which is certainly in conflict with the US interests.\\nAnd finally, contradictions between the USA and China can reach their pinnacle in relation to the actively promoted by China idea of creating a new regional security system in the APR, that should replace the currently functioning system based primarily on the bilateral allied relations between the USA and the five countries of the region. On the basis of statements from Chinese high officials, heard throughout the last year, Washington has come to the conclusion that Beijing intends to bolster the creation of the new system of regional security without the US\\u2019 participation under the principle \\u2018Asia for Asians\\u2019.\\nYana\\u00a0Leksyutina, Dr. Sc., Associate Professor at Saint-Petersburg State University,\\u00a0exlusively\\u00a0for the online magazine\\u00a0\\u201cNew Eastern Outlook.\\u201c \\nArticle source: http:\\/\\/journal-neo.org\\/2015\\/04\\/17\\/rus-ssha-i-kitaj-rost-protivorechij-v-sfere-bezopasnosti-v-atr\\/&#13;\\n&#13;\\n&#13;\\n\",\n                \"source\": \"news.windowstorussia.com\",\n                \"publishDate\": \"2015-04-18T18:10:39+02:00\",\n                \"sourceType\": \"blog\",\n                \"language\": \"en\",\n                \"googleRank\": 3,\n                \"relatedDocs\": [\n\n                ]\n            },\n            {\n                \"id\": 186433327,\n                \"url\": \"http:\\/\\/polforumblogroll.blogspot.com\\/2015\\/04\\/fwd-grendelreport-hackers-not-suicide.html\",\n                \"title\": \"\\n                                            \\u00a0Israeli Cyber Expert: Hackers, Not Suicide Bombers, Will Cause Next 9\\/11The next 9\\/11-style terror attack will be perpetrated by hackers infiltrating an a\",\n                \"content\": \"\\n                                            \\u00a0Israeli Cyber Expert: Hackers, Not Suicide Bombers, Will Cause Next 9\\/11The next 9\\/11-style terror attack will be perpetrated by hackers infiltrating an air traffic control system or other critical infrastructure, according to\\u00a0Col.

The Times of Israel reported \\u00a0on Siboni's assessment Wednesday.\\\"Computer hackers have begun targeting electric and nuclear power plants and other critical operations around the world in audacious and continuous efforts to take control of them.\\\" \\u2026\\\"The next 9\\/11 will happen without suicide bombers aboard the plane with box-cutters but will occur because of a cyber incident perpetrated by a terror organization,\\\" he said.\\\"Cyber aggression is widely utilized and has become a basic weapon used in international conflicts. Countries are responsible for attacks on most national infrastructure, and governments across the Western world have understood that they must allocate resources not only to purchase new tanks and aerial defense systems but also in defensive cyber infrastructure,\\\" he added.Siboni offered his assessment in advance of an American-Israel cybersecurity conference scheduled to take place later this\\u00a0month in Washington D.C. Siboni called on the United States and Israel to increase their cooperation in order to counter this threat.Last year saw major multinational corporations investing in Israel's growing cyber-security hub.\\u00a0This past\\u00a0October \\u00a0The Washington Post reported that Israel had become the number two exporter of cyber products and was becoming a \\\"cybersecurity superpower.\\\" In February, The New York Times reported that the United States was increasingly turning to allies Britain and Israel to counter the cyber threats emanating from Iran.Illustrating how \\\"[c]yber aggression\\\" has become a weapon utilized in conflicts, Claudia Rosett wrote in How Iran and North Korea Became Cyber-Terror Buddies, which was published in the January 2015 issue of The Tower Magazine:The Sony hack has monopolized media attention over the past month, and finally aroused public concern over the cyber-warfare capabilities of rogue states like North Korea. There are signs of Iranian involvement in the attack, but no conclusive evidence. There is conclusive evidence, however, of far-ranging collaboration between North Korea and Iran on cyber-warfare and numerous other forms of military technology.These go far beyond the realm of cyberspace. They include such devastating conventional weapons as ballistic missiles and\\u2014most importantly\\u2014the development of nuclear technology and nuclear weapons. Clearly, the relationship between these two rogue totalitarian states represents a clear and present danger to the entire free world.The really important question, then, is not precisely who hacked Sony's computer network. It is what we might see if the administration rolled back the curtain and showed us whatever it knows about the full extent of North Korea's rogue ventures, especially its long-standing romance with Iran.[Photo: iloque \\/ Flickr ]\\u00a0\\u00a0                            __._,_.___                                                                                                                                                              __,_._,___            --   --   Thanks for being part of \\\"PoliticalForum\\\" at Google Groups.
