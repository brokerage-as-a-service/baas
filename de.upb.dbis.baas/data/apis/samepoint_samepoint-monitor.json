This is worth the read!   BEST SUMMATION OF BARACK AND MICHELLE EVER! Mychal Massie is a respected writer and... talk show host in Los Angeles . The other evening on my twitter, a person asked me why I didn't like the Obama's? Specifically I was asked: \\\"I have to ask, why do you hate the Obama's? It seems personal, not policy related. You even dissed (disrespect) their Christmas family picture.\\\"  The truth is I do not like the Obamas, what they represent, their ideology, and I certainly do not like his policies and legislation. I've made no secret of my contempt for the Obamas. As I responded to the person who asked me the aforementioned question, I don't like them because they are committed to the fundamental change of my/our country into what can only be regarded as a Communist state.   I don't hate them per definition, but I condemn them because they are the worst kind of racialists, they are elitist Leninists with contempt for traditional America . They display disrespect for the sanctity of the office he holds, and for those who are willing to admit same, Michelle Obama's raw contempt for white America is transpicuous. I don't like them because they comport themselves as emperor and empress.   I expect, no I demand respect, for the Office of President and a love of our country and her citizenry from the leader entrusted with the governance of same. President and Mrs. Reagan displayed an unparalleled love for the country and her people.   The Reagan's made Americans feel good about themselves and about what we could accomplish. Obama's arrogance by appointing 32 leftist czars and constantly bypassing congress is impeachable. Eric Holder is probably the MOST incompetent and arrogant DOJ head to ever hold the job. Could you envision President Reagan instructing his Justice Department to act like jack-booted thugs?   Presidents are politicians and all politicians are known and pretty much expected to manipulate the truth, if not outright lie, but even using that low standard, the Obama's have taken lies, dishonesty, deceit, mendacity, subterfuge and obfuscation to new depths. They are verbally abusive to the citizenry, and they display an animus for civility.   I do not like them, because they both display bigotry overtly, as in the case of Harvard Professor Louis Gates, when he accused the Cambridge Police of acting stupidly, and her code speak pursuant to not being able to be proud of America . I view that statement and that mindset as an insult to those who died to provide a country where a Kenyan, his illegal alien relatives, and his alleged progeny, could come and not only live freely, but rise to the highest, most powerful, position in the world.   Michelle Obama is free to hate and disparage whites because Americans of every description paid with their blood to ensure her right to do same. I have a saying, that \\\"the only reason a person hides things, is because they have something to hide.\\\" No president in history has spent millions of dollars to keep his records and his past sealed.   And what the two of them have shared has been proved to be lies. He lied about when and how they met, he lied about his mother's death and problems with insurance, Michelle lied to a crowd pursuant to nearly $500,000 bank stocks they inherited from his family. He has lied about his father's military service, about the civil rights movement, ad nausea. He lied to the world about the Supreme Court in a State of the Union address. He berated and publicly insulted a sitting Congressman. He has surrounded himself with the most rabidly, radical, socialist academicians today.   He opposed rulings that protected women and children that even Planned Parenthood did not seek to support. He is openly hostile to business and aggressively hostile to Israel . His wife treats being the First Lady as her personal American Express Black Card (arguably the most prestigious credit card in the world). I condemn them because, as people are suffering, losing their homes, their jobs, their retirements, he and his family are arrogantly showing off their life of entitlement - as he goes about creating and fomenting class warfare.   I don't like them, and I neither apologize nor retreat from my public condemnation of them and of his policies. We should condemn them for the disrespect they show our people, for his willful and unconstitutional actions pursuant to obeying the Constitutional parameters he is bound by, and his willful disregard for Congressional authority.   Dislike for them has nothing to do with the color of their skin; it has everything to do with their behavior, attitudes, and policies. And I have open scorn for their constantly playing the race card.   I could go on, but let me conclude with this. I condemn in the strongest possible terms the media for refusing to investigate them, as they did President Bush and President Clinton, and for refusing to label them for what they truly are. There is no scenario known to man, whereby a white president and his wife could ignore laws, flaunt their position, and lord over the people, as these two are permitted out of fear for their color.   As I wrote in a syndicated column titled, \\\"Nero In The White House\\\" - \\\"Never in my life, inside or outside of politics, have I witnessed such dishonesty in a political leader. He is the most mendacious political figure I have ever witnessed. Even by the low standards of his presidential predecessors, his narcissistic, contumacious arrogance is unequaled. Using Obama as the bar, Nero would have to be elevated to sainthood...   Many in America wanted to be proud when the first person of color was elected president, but instead, they have been witness to a congenital liar, a woman who has been ashamed of America her entire life, failed policies,  intimidation, and a commonality hitherto not witnessed in political leaders. He and his wife view their life at our expense as an entitlement - while America 's people go homeless, hungry and unemployed.\\\"\",\n      \"sentiment\": -5,\n      \"sentiment_reason\": \"Sentiment

and theft of corporate and government secrets by Chinese hackers. www.nytimes.com U.S. and China Agree to Hold Regular Talks on Hacking By DAVID E. SANGER and MARK LANDLER Published: June 1, 2013  WASHINGTON &mdash; The United States and China have agreed to hold regular, high-level talks on how to set standards of behavior for cybersecurity and commercial espionage, the first diplomatic effort to defuse the tensions over what the United States says is a daily barrage of computer break-ins and theft of corporate and government secrets.  The talks will begin in July. Next Friday, President Obama and President Xi Jinping of China, who took office this spring, are scheduled to hold an unusual, informal summit meeting in Rancho Mirage, Calif., that could set the tone for their relationship and help them confront chronic tensions like the nuclear threat from North Korea.   American officials say they do not expect the process to immediately yield a significant reduction in the daily intrusions from China. The head of the United States Cyber Command and director of the National Security Agency, Gen. Keith B. Alexander, has said the attacks have resulted in the &ldquo;greatest transfer of wealth in history.&rdquo; Hackers have stolen a variety of secrets, including negotiating strategies and schematics for next-generation fighter jets and gas pipeline control systems.   Nonetheless, a senior American official involved in the negotiations to hold regular meetings said in an interview on Friday that &ldquo;we need to get some norms and rules.&rdquo;   &ldquo;It is a serious issue that cannot simply be swatted away with talking points,&rdquo; said the official, who noted that the meetings would focus primarily on the theft of intellectual property from American companies. &ldquo;Our concerns are not limited to that, but that&rsquo;s what needs urgent attention,&rdquo; he added.   The Chinese government has insisted it is a victim of cyberattacks, not a perpetrator, and Chinese officials have vigorously denied the extensive evidence gathered by the Pentagon and private security experts that a unit of the People&rsquo;s Liberation Army, Unit 61398 outside Shanghai, is behind many of the most sophisticated attacks on the United States.   On Saturday, after Defense Secretary Chuck Hagel spoke of a &ldquo;growing threat of cyberintrusions&rdquo; at a conference in Singapore, in comments directed at China, a Chinese general gave a tart response saying she doubted the United States&rsquo; assurances that its growing military presence in Asia was not directed at China.   While cyberattacks will be a major subject of the talks in Rancho Mirage, at an estate that belonged to Walter Annenberg, the main effort will be to forge a rapport between Mr. Obama and Mr. Xi. American officials hope the estate, known as Sunnylands, which has played host to American presidents and foreign dignitaries dating to Richard M. Nixon, will put both men at ease.   American officials said they have been surprised by the pace at which Mr. Xi, a longtime party functionary who consolidated his grip on power in March, has installed new faces in the Chinese leadership and moved to take greater control over the military, something his predecessor, Hu Jintao, never mastered.   Another main issue at the meeting will be North Korea. American officials, emerging from talks with Mr. Xi and his team, believe that the new Chinese leader has less patience for North Korea and little of the sentimental attachment to its leaders that his predecessors had.   &ldquo;What&rsquo;s interesting here is the dog that isn&rsquo;t barking,&rdquo; the American official said. The Chinese, he noted, are not urging all sides to resume talks until the North Koreans agree that the objective is removing all nuclear weapons from the Korean Peninsula. &ldquo;We&rsquo;re not hearing the soothing mantra of restraint,&rdquo; he said.   The Chinese have also taken public steps to confront North Korea, like ordering the Bank of China to stop dealing with North Korea&rsquo;s largest foreign-exchange bank.   &ldquo;They&rsquo;re much more open to causing pain to North Korea,&rdquo; said Jeffrey A. Bader, a top China adviser to Mr. Obama until 2011.   Still, during the latest round of the Korea crisis this spring, Kim Jong-un, the young and largely untested new North Korean leader, made it clear that he had no intention of ever giving up his small arsenal.   Cybersecurity issues loom large between the United States and China because they go to the heart of the economic relationship between the two countries, even more so now that previous sources of friction, like China&rsquo;s foreign exchange policies, have eased in the last year.   Chinese academics and industrialists say that if China is to maintain its annual economic growth rate of 7 or 8 percent, it needs a steady inflow of new technology. That could make the Chinese reluctant to cut back on the systematic theft of intellectual property.   In return, the Chinese will press the Americans on their use of cyberweapons: while there is no evidence that they have been used against Chinese targets, the sophisticated cyberattacks on Iran&rsquo;s nuclear program by the United States and Israel are often cited by the Chinese news media and military journals as evidence that Washington, too, uses cyberspace for strategic advantage.   The talks over computer hacking will start as part of the Strategic and Economic Dialogue, an annual meeting of Chinese and American officials on a broad range of issues. But a new working group is being organized on the subject that will meet more frequently, officials say.   Where the talks will lead, however, is unclear: after considerable debate within the Obama administration, officials have concluded that online conflict does not lend itself to the kind of arms control treaties that the United States and the Soviet Union began negotiating 50 years ago. Today, cyberweapons are held by private individuals as well as states, and figuring out where an attack began can be maddeningly difficult.   Another problem, China experts said, is that neither the Americans nor the Chinese are well prepared for a candid discussion of cyberissues. The growth of hacking, and its use in both military and corporate espionage, is a new enough phenomenon that it is not clear how seriously Mr. Xi and other senior Chinese leaders view it.   Tung Chee-hwa, a former chief executive of Hong Kong who has close ties to China&rsquo;s leaders, said recently that when he raises the American concerns about hacking with senior officials in Beijing, they express puzzlement.   And neither side, experts said, is ready to discuss military espionage, which means the conversation will necessarily focus on the theft of corporate secrets by China-based hackers. On that subject, they said, Mr. Obama needs to be unyielding.   &ldquo;Obama has got to say, &lsquo;You&rsquo;ve got a major hacking operation under way in Beijing, you&rsquo;ve got a major hacking operation under way in Shanghai. This is going to have repercussions if we don&rsquo;t see changes very quickly,&rsquo; &rdquo; said Kenneth G. Lieberthal, a China adviser in the Clinton administration who is now at the Brookings Institution.   China and the United States, experts say, could find common ground on the need to stop cyberattacks on critical national infrastructure, like the electrical grid, since it poses such a danger to both countries. &ldquo;I personally think a bilateral &lsquo;no sabotage&rsquo; pledge would be a very good idea,&rdquo; Mr. Bader said.\",\n      \"sentiment\": -2,\n      \"sentiment_reason\": \"Sentiment set to negative because the percentage of negative attributes are low and there are negative emotions.

Dois projetos de lei semelhantes foram propostos desde 2006, mas esta  a primeira vez que foi aprovado pela Assembleia Nacional. &ldquo;As pessoas que entram em um contrato de casamento do mesmo sexo ou unio civil cometem um crime e so passveis de condenao a uma pena de 14 anos de priso,&rdquo; diz o projeto de lei. &ldquo;Qualquer pessoa que se registre, opere ou participe em clubes gays, sociedades e organizaes ou faz, direta ou indiretamente, demonstrao pblica de relacionamento amoroso de mesmo sexo na Nigria comete um delito, devendo cada um ser passvel de condenao a uma pena de 10 anos de priso.&rdquo; A nova legislao certamente receber apoio popular, pois assim como em grande parte da frica subsaariana,  comum as pessoas na Nigria verem o homossexualismo como uma aberrao. Sob a atual lei federal nigeriana, a sodomia  punida com uma pena leve de priso, mas a lei aprovada caminha para uma pena mais pesada de priso. A Gr-Bretanha e outros pases ocidentais, que adotam a linha do imperialismo cultural pr-homossexualismo, esto usando toda a sua truculncia contra as populaes e governos que manifestarem apoio a esse tipo de projeto, ameaando cortar a ajuda internacional, inclusive assistncia para crianas. S recebero ajuda os pases que se submeterem s exigncias pr-homossexualismo do Ocidente. As presses e ameaas ocidentais tm contribudo para retardar ou inviabilizar a aprovao de legislaes em pases dependentes, como Uganda e Malaui, que queriam proteger suas sociedades e culturas da invaso da agenda gay ocidental em suas naes, mas no tiveram foras diante da truculncia e poderio financeiro e poltico de pases como EUA e Inglaterra.

Ta ai uma excelente noti'cia num mar de agressoes. Esse extremismo e' excelente, e so' assim se combate essa gang biliona'ria que atacam nossas criancas no mundo. Esses criminosos homossexuais militantes passaram e muito dos limites de liberdade e devem ser punidos com severidade. Agridem as os pais e as criancas com apoios de governos comunistas na ONU e ficam impunes. Isso prova a ONU que ainda ha' paises independentes e livres. Casamento de viados e' uma farsa, um teatro, ou melhor,,,um circo com dois palhacos. Um finge ser mulher, o outro finge acreditar. Isto e',,,dois porcos fedorentos e barbudos fazendo essa cena grotesca e aberrante, querer chamar isso de casamento ???,,,tenha do',,,,nao e' a toa que eu sou homofo'bico ate' os ossos. Esses militantes homossexuais sao tao perigosos, que aqui no EUA conseguiram se infiltrar no partido republicano, como poli'ticos para enfraquecer o TeaParty,,,e conseguiram,,,entao voce vota pensando que esta votando num Republicano,,,,na verdade esta votando num comunista.     sbado, 01 junho, 2013  Annimo disse...      O mundo estah a cada dia mais loko. Nos EUA, que foram canal de bencaos sem fim de Deus para a humanidade, o usurpador presidente eh macom, komunista e muculmano, sem falar que eh alienigena originario do Kenia. A Rusiia, que hospedou em primeira mao a religiao mais satanica que existiu e existirah, que o eskerdismo/socialismo/komunismo/marxismo/satanismo, sim, o pais que serviu para a central de satanas na terra, hah pouco comecou a valorizar a famila (embora, pra \\\"ingles ver\\\"). Agora, a Nigeria, um dos paises mais corruptos do mundo (se nao eh o mais), que, inclusive, a populacao de mais de cem milhoes de habitantes, um terco eh macumbeiros, um terco eh muculmanos e um terco adotou o catolicismo, vem dar essa travada na agenda do inferno. Como dizia o humorista: \\\"Nao precisa explicar; eu soh queria entender\\\"      Antonio.     sbado, 01 junho, 2013  Annimo disse...

Sobre essa excelente noticia que nos alegra a mente , a alma e o espirito reflito que ainda h esperana no mundo para o combate contra a ditadura GAY que est destruindo famlias, comunidades e naes inteiras.     Tomara que aqui, em terras tupiniquins esse belo exemplo seja seguido para tentar salvar a famlia brasileira desa anormalidade e aberrao psicolgica que sempre representou o movimento GAY.

You will survive Obama.\",\n      \"content\": \"The anti-argument against rape states women who dress scantily are asking for unwanted attention and advances and therefore should not dress that way to avoid such a situation.  Those who believe this are advocates of trading away liberty.  The premise of the argument is women should give away their freedom to express themselves by dressing anyway they see fit for the safety of possibly not luring a rapist to be overcome with attraction to attack them.

Numerous press reports are providing details of a massacre perpetrated by the Free Syrian Army that annihilated the entire population of a Christian village.  As the New York Times reported last December, anti-American sentiment has grown among the rebel organizations even as the American government has played a key role in propping up the rebellion. A crucial step in that support was the administration&rsquo;s decision to give formal recognition to rebel organizations &mdash; a step just short of recognizing them as the legitimate government of Syria. But now, those rebels Obama has vehemently supported are now proving that in Syria &mdash; as in Egypt several years ago &mdash; the rebels may prove worse than the tyrants they struggle to overthrow.  According to the Assyrian International News Agency (AINA), forces of the Free Syrian Army massacred the village on May 27: &ldquo;The armed rebels affiliated to the Free Syrian Army (FSA) raided the Christian-populated al-Duvair village in Reef (outskirts of) Homs near the border with Lebanon today and massacred all its civilian residents, including women and children. The Syrian army, however, intervened and killed tens of terrorists during heavy clashes which are still going on in al-Duvair village.&rdquo;  Although the United States had opposed the involvement of the al-Qaeda-affiliated Nusra Front in the rebel coalition, it did not express such reservations in December when Obama lavished his praise on the coalition. As the New York Times reported at that time:  But Mr. Obama praised the opposition, known formally as the National Coalition of Syrian Revolutionary and Opposition Forces, for what he said was its inclusiveness, its openness to various ethnic and religious groups, and its ties to local councils involved in the fighting against Mr. Assad&rsquo;s security forces.  &ldquo;At this point we have a well-organized-enough coalition &mdash; opposition coalition that is representative &mdash; that we can recognize them as the legitimate representative of Syrian people,&rdquo; he said.&hellip;   The United States has played an active role behind the scenes in shaping the opposition, insisting that it be broadened and made more inclusive. But until Mr. Obama&rsquo;s announcement, the United States had held off on formally recognizing the opposition, asserting that it wanted to use the lure of recognition to encourage the rebel leaders to flesh out their political structure and fill important posts.  Now Obama&rsquo;s inclusive opposition has allegedly slaughtered the entire population of al-Duvair, which is the type of crime that the U.S. president has previously purported was sufficient reason for the people of Syria to rise up and overthrow their government. And the massacre is hardly an isolated incident; for example, only several weeks ago, rebels attacked the St. Elijah Orthodoxy monastery. As Voice of Russia reported on May 12: &ldquo;The militants ransacked the cloister, destroyed the sanctuary, blew up the belfry and tore down the statue of St. Prophet Elijah who is equally revered in Syria by both Christians and Muslims, Syria&rsquo;s SANA news agency reports, quoting the head of the monastery, hegumen Gadir Ibrahim. The hegumen believes the attack to be the work of foreign mercenaries.&rdquo;  Reports of foreign mercenaries are nothing new in the war against the Assad regime, and the &ldquo;Syrian&rdquo; character of the rebellion has been in doubt for some time. As the Independent reported on December 20:  Fighters from as many as 29 countries have filtered into Syria to join a civil war that has split along sectarian lines, increasingly pitting the ruling Alawite community against the majority Sunni Muslims, UN human rights investigators said today.  The deepened sectarian divisions in Syria may diminish prospects for post-conflict reconciliation even if President Bashar al-Assad is toppled. And the influx of foreign fighters raises the risk of the war spilling into neighbouring countries.  &ldquo;As battles between government forces and anti-government armed groups approach the end of their second year, the conflict has become overtly sectarian in nature,&rdquo; the investigators led by Brazilian expert Paulo Pinheiro said in an updated report.&hellip;   Most of the foreign fighters slipping into Syria to join rebel groups, or fight alongside them, are Sunnis from other countries in the Middle East and North Africa, the UN investigators found. &ldquo;They come from all over, Europe and America, and especially the neighbouring countries,&rdquo; said Ms [Karen] Abuzayd.  Even as the American government has expanded its involvement in the war in Syria, the radicalization of the rebel forces has continued. While Syrian rebels perpetrate their own atrocities, Sen. John McCain (R-Ariz.) was still insisting &ldquo;We can identify who these people are. We can help the right people.&rdquo; As Reuters reported on May 29:  U.S. Senator John McCain said on Wednesday, two days after meeting with rebels in Syria, that he is confident the United States can send weapons to fighters in Syria without the risk they will fall into the wrong hands.  \\\"We can identify who these people are. We can help the right people,\\\" McCain said on CNN's program \\\"Anderson Cooper 360.\\\" &hellip;   Critics of some lawmakers' push to arm the rebels have expressed concerns that weapons could end up in the hands of militants who might eventually end up using them against the United States or its allies.  But McCain said such radical fighters make up only a small part of the rebels forces.  For example, he said, Syria's Islamist al-Nusra Front, identified as an alias of al Qaeda in Iraq, accounts for only about 7,000 of the 100,000 fighters battling the government of Assad.  \\\"Every single day, more and more extremists flow in.... \\\"They're flowing in all the time, these extremists. But they still do not make up a sizeable portion,\\\" the Arizona senator said.  When 7,000 members of an al-Qaeda front are acknowledged to be part of a US-backed coalition, one wonders how McCain and his allies are now defining &ldquo;small.&rdquo; And as McCain&rsquo;s and Obama&rsquo;s purported &ldquo;right people&rdquo; are busy massacring Christians &mdash; and others &mdash; in an &ldquo;overtly sectarian&rdquo; war conducted by foreign mercenaries and religious fanatics, the latest phase in the &ldquo;perpetual war for perpetual peace&rdquo; has moved on to the phase where its proponents will soon, once again, be \\\"shocked\\\" by the actions of their allies.

Place yourself in the shoes of a 29 year old graduate liberal arts student who did not inherit the gun-money-diamond power of Nicholas Oppenheimer, because there is only one Nick Oppenheimer who is fat, ugly and has a disproportionately large head.  You have also not produced a whole bunch of co-dependent children and are about to graduate with a post graduate degree and having already tucked under your belt some \\\"street experience\\\", and now left to complete one course about the concentration camps during WW II.  You run into me who is not being spoken about by the media, which I understand, and I then in the course of 30 seconds I take you to Ch.9 of The Diamond Invention book, how long before you tell all your university friends and family members that you like, that they need to listen up?  Notice that you are still breathing just like when you took your first breath.  When you inhale you feel less in control then when you breath out, and you know that you have less breaths ahead of you than when you started life.  Now let's assume that you are this 29 year old reading this, and you already know why it is that Sir Ernest Oppenheimer is not a name that was on the tip of your tongue before I began mentioning it and why it is if you have a need for money to start your business and/or destroy your competition you would go to one of Oppenheimer's companies where you will find the lowest cost loans because De Beers and their affiliates have a zero cost of capital.  How many of you who have had all this information for quite some time still manage to force yourselves to listen to what better known people than me are talking about when it comes to your money, or do you find that it is no struggle at all because you have convinced yourselves that if what I had to say was all that important then I would already be a household name and the first thing that would happen is that there would be an immediate suspension in the trading of shares of public corporations?  You know that if the Chairman of the US Federal Reserve has not already explained to you all why it is that Sir Ernest Oppenheimer was unknown to the masses and yet everyone has heard of J.D. Rockefeller, it is either because Mr. Bernanke and his predecessor, Alan Greenspan were either stupid or lying to you.  When you know that you have got the wrong information and yet you continue on like nothing has happened would you expect yourself to get more intelligent or dumber?  Does the feeling of stupid bring with it a happy or :( feeling?  Does it make sense to you that of all the people you know in the world that I would be the number one target of the people most profiting from keeping all of you in the dark, but for some reason, you are more angry with me than everyone else, other than yourself?  Do you find yourself liking your company as much as when you remember liking yourself the most?  If you were in my shoes would you be telling yourself that before I write my best selling book D-Money Lie I should wait until I am dead or would you be more focused on learning about the book publishing business even though there isn't anything about the book publishing business that you don't know?  Can anyone advise me on how I best get my information out and at the same time stay alive and enjoy life to the full?  Do you think it is wise that because I don't know whether tonight is going to be my last night that I should go out this evening and stuff myself like a pig and then wake up tomorrow morning hating myself to death and still I am breathing and knowing that there is no way to make up for being illogical in my choice of foods unless that meant in the process of being stupid I would attract someone more beautiful than my French-Canadian wife to sleep with?  When you are old and notice that you are not attractive to young people as you once were do you think your stupid thinking about food and what you drink has impacted your looks much the same way as your stupid thoughts?  Again, were you in my shoes, who out there would you be trying to impress?  When you look at fat people do you still think that they must be smart to have money otherwise why would anyone listen to someone who has trouble controlling their willpower unless they no longer have willpower?  If you are fat and don't know how the money is valued and why it is that the most unhealthiest foods are very inexpensive, that is very sad, but still that does not mean that those who are withholding the information from you were doing the right thing.  How do you compensate all the fat people who are fat because they were intentionally made ignorant not to ask the right questions?  Obama is not fat, so what is his excuse for making sure that Sir Ernest Oppenheimer remains an unknown to the masses?  Would you consider it evil if it turns out that Obama knows everything you all know about Sir Ernest Oppenheimer and his grandson Nicholas Oppenheimer?  If Barak Obama was not President of the United States of America and was just one of you reading this, would you say he was just as bad as you for not sharing the information?  Remember, all I am doing is trying to get people to start thinking because I know how difficult it is to acknowledge how stupid it feels to put up with people you helped get elected who you know cannot be trusted with either thinking smart or honestly and at some point your minds have to tell you that they are lying when not acknowledging the importance of the photo showing Putin in a very subservient position to someone who people like Obama should know as well as Putin.  This is all rather bizarre, don't you think?  You have never read a fiction novel or seen a horror movie close this.  Your minds also tell you that there is a number of people reading this which would convince you that everyone you know including Obama would understand all this as well as you, and that number we don't all have to agree on.  What provides you with comfort that nothing is going to change much if at all is your conviction that if it was going to happen it would have happened a long time ago, and besides all my information could easily be wiped out since it is mostly digital.  I also understand how very unimportant is the truth when it comes to making an honest living.  You have most likely not thought all that much about how hard the US Congress and President Obama work to make the money they make as they have to be constantly making speeches and that much more aware that their lies will inevitably catch up with them because their job description does not say they are allowed to lie unless it is in the interest of national security.  Sir Ernest Oppenheimer knew what he was doing when putting President Franklin D. Roosevelt and the US Congress on the spot, because he was quite certain, that despite not being an American citizen he was the most powerful person in the world only because he was smart enough to bribe the most powerful American politicians who put their personal interest ahead of the nation.  You would expect if you were Oppenheimer to bribe them with untraceable diamonds which didn't prevent Oppenheimer from also using highly paid prostitutes who wouldn't have all had tattooed on their tits the words, \\\"I am a prostitute\\\".  There was nothing funny about 6 million Jewish people murdered during the very brief Jewish Holocaust being first given a number that was tattooed on to their skin.  You would agree that is different than using one's free will to enter a tattoo parlor.  We have now moved on from logic to morals.  How would you judge the morals of Obama and the US Congress compared to your own?  Wouldn't you like your nightmares to end with Obama explaining his read of Edward Jay Epstein's The Diamond Invention book that was written in the same year that I emigrated from De Beers' South Africa to the United States of America and knowing when I landed at Chicago's O'Hare International Airport that so long as I kept my mouth shut and got through the mental gymnastic exercises I would soon be working for De Beers who decide what is marketed to their common herd?  Couldn't you see yourselves or even your dumbest next of kin being able to explain all this rather well unless they were so severely retarded that they couldn't feed themselves?  To think that not a single politician or academic or radio or TV talk show host has yet to question how corrupt was President Franklin D. Roosevelt when failing to at least have Sir Ernest Oppenheimer arrested for refusing his order and if that was not possible to have his Secretary of State instruct the CIA-OSS to assassinate Oppenheimer and at least save the lives of 6 million Jewish people?  7 decades of complete silence.  What do you think prompted his grandson Nicholas to present such a \\\"show of force\\\" on September 5, 2006?  Could it be that Nick O. was frightened by all your silence?  Put yourself in his shoes, would you be bothered that I would be so convincing that my mother Zena would warn me, \\\"ARE YOU NOT CONCERNED FOR YOUR LIFE!!\\\" and for the past going on 9 years my mother has lived as if I was already dead?  My mother and I didn't have a \\\"fallout\\\"; I just said that I believed the time was right to expose the Oppenheimers who never demonstrated that they meant us Jewish people well when providing Hitler with his diamonds and nor did De Beers explain what they did with the diamonds that Hitler did not use.  Even simpletons can read simple English.  You can all look back and see that Oppenheimer had no intention of complying with Roosevelt's Presidential Order otherwise he would have.  The United States Justice Department are also able to read and see that the negative consequences for the Oppenheimer family and their corporations throughout the world were not as devastating as they were to the 6 million horribly murdered.  You hear of \\\"slaps on the wrists\\\" that De Beers carefully orchestrate against themselves, but no war crimes tribunal has been convened, not even close.  It is hard to turn back the clock because it is impossible.  So people continue to function; that is normal.  What do you consider normal when the most abnormal situation took place that no one wants to talk about now, but still they cannot get enough of their History and nature channels.  When they were murdering the 6 million Jewish people and 40 million Russians and Chinese, there was more food available to the soldiers who survived.  That was very thoughtful of you.  Now I am speaking for all of you, and I have stopped that.  You see it does not matter how Sir Ernest Oppenheimer bribed Roosevelt and the US Congress because all that matters is that the lives of the 6 million Jewish people and the 40 million Russians and Chinese were not all that important.  Would you feel better or worse if Roosevelt and the US Congress were given a controlling interest in De Beers and their affiliates and then able to use the inheritance laws to pass them down to their offspring?  It looks like they committed mass murder as well as treason against the United States of America for pennies.  How much do you think would be a reasonable price for me to have to pay an editor?  How many of you would be willing to pay in advance for a first edition copy of my book?  What value do you think Nicholas Oppenheimer placed on getting Vladimir Putin to journey all the way to Johannesburg, South Africa on September 5, 2006 to have a photo of Putin looking hugely skeptical as Oppenheimer speaks, gesturing with his right hand?  Remember, neither Putin nor Oppenheimer have said that it is fake.  While lawyer President Obama never got explained when he was a law school student at Harvard Law School that price, including the price of the aircraft fuel to bring Putin to South Africa costs De Beers nothing as it is only resources that are consumed which brainwashed people don't understand but they think they are bright because someone unintelligent told them that they are and they got the math question right when asked how much 1 +1 equals, and they think because money has a number associated with it that the money is therefore as certain any number otherwise there would be more people arguing about the value of the money which they don't think is important because they prefer to argue about the things they are brainwashed to argue about such as whether Meryl Streep was putting on her best performance in her last movie, it does not mean that Putin was stupid when agreeing to come to South Africa as well as when he instructed the Kremlin to release that photo that speaks for itself 759 days later.  If your head pains too much and you are concerned about the side effects of a self performed frontal lobotomy because that is all you feel will lessen the pain, consider stopping reading.

These strikes were begun by President George W. Bush and have increased substantially under President Barack Obama.[4] Some media refer to the series of attacks as a \\\"drone war\\\".[5][6] Estimates of those killed in strikes between 2004 and early 2013 range from around 2000 to around 3000; estimates of the proportion of civilian deaths vary dramatically.The United States government has made hundreds of attacks on targets in northwest Pakistan since 2004 using drones (unmanned aerial vehicles) controlled by the American Central Intelligence Agency's Special Activities Division.[3] Most of these attacks are on targets in the Federally Administered Tribal Areas along the Afghan border in Northwest Pakistan. These strikes were begun by President George W. Bush and have increased substantially under President Barack Obama.[4] Some media refer to the series of attacks as a \\\"drone war\\\".[5][6]  Pakistan's government publicly condemns these attacks, but has secretly shared intelligence with the United States[7] and also allegedly allowed the drones to operate from Shamsi Airfield in Pakistan until 21 April 2011, when 150 Americans left the base.[8] According to secret diplomatic cables leaked by Wikileaks, Pakistan's Army Chief Ashfaq Parvez Kayani not only tacitly agreed to the drone flights, but in 2008 requested Americans to increase them.[9] However, Pakistan's Interior Minister Rehman Malik said, \\\"drone missiles cause collateral damage. A few militants are killed, but the majority of victims are innocent citizens.\\\"[10] The strikes are often linked to anti-American sentiment in Pakistan and the growing questionability of the scope and extent of CIA activities in Pakistan.  Reports of the number of militants versus civilian casualties differ.[11] According to the Pakistani authorities, 60 cross-border predator strikes in the period from January 2006 to April 2009 killed 14 wanted al-Qaeda leaders and 687 Pakistani civilians.[12][13] In a 2009 opinion article, Daniel L. Byman of the Brookings Institution wrote that drone strikes may have killed \\\"10 or so civilians\\\" for every \\\"mid- and high-ranking [al Qaeda and Taliban] leader.\\\"[14] In contrast, the New America Foundation has estimated that 80 percent of those killed in the attacks were militants.[15] The Pakistani military has stated that most of those killed were Al-Qaeda and Taliban militants.[16] The CIA believes that the strikes conducted since May 2010 have killed over 600 militants and have not caused any civilian fatalities, a claim that some experts disputed.[11] The Bureau of Investigative Journalism found that between 391 &ndash; 780 civilians were killed out of a total of between 1,658 and 2,597 and that 160 children are reported among the deaths. The Bureau also revealed that since President Obama took office at least 50 civilians were killed in follow-up strikes when they had gone to help victims and more than 20 civilians have also been attacked in deliberate strikes on funerals and mourners, tactics that have been condemned by legal experts.[17][18][19]  Barbara Elias-Sanborn has also claimed that, \\\"as much of the literature on drones suggests, such killings usually harden militants' determination to fight, stalling any potential negotiations and settlement.\\\"[20] However, analysis by the RAND Corporation suggests that \\\"drone strikes are associated with decreases in both the frequency and the lethality of militant attacks overall and in IED and suicide attacks specifically.\\\"[21]  A motive that the 2010 Times Square car bomber Faisal Shahzad stated was the repeated CIA drone attacks in Pakistan, his native country.[22]  Drone strikes were halted in November 2011 after NATO forces killed 24 Pakistani soldiers in the Salala incident.[23] Shamsi Airfield was evacuated of Americans and taken over by the Pakistanis December 2011.[24] The incident prompted an approximately two-month stop to the drone strikes, which resumed on 10 January 2012.  In March 2013, Ben Emmerson, the United Nations Special Rapporteur led a U.N. team that looked into civilian casualties from the U.S. drone attacks, and stated that the attacks are a violation of the sovereignty of Pakistan. Emmerson said government officials from the country clearly stated Pakistan does not agree to the drone attacks, which is contradicted by U.S. officials.[25]1) US Drone Strike Statistics estimate according to the New America Foundation.[26] (As of 17 April 2013) Year  Number of Attacks  Number Killed Min.

Russell George answers questions as the House Oversight Committee holds a hearing to investigate the extra scrutiny the Internal Revenue Service gave Tea Party and other conservative groups that applied for tax-exempt status, on Capitol Hill in Washington. Most of what Americans know about their government&rsquo;s crimes, misdeeds and foul-ups comes from the government itself. Washington&rsquo;s investigation machine never quits. Federal law calls for 73 inspectors general to watch over the work of Cabinet departments, agencies and commissions. About 14,000 auditors, analysts, lawyers and other staff, including armed criminal investigators, make up the IG force. (AP Photo/J. Scott Applewhite, File) WASHINGTON (AP) - Washington never stops investigating itself.  The probes that go public - what happened at the Internal Revenue Service, or in Benghazi, Libya, or with the seizure of journalists' phone and email records - are just a sampling. Thousands of federal workers spend hundreds of millions of dollars a year checking up on their peers. And Congress is watching, too.  Is this gotcha gallery trustworthy? Are investigators running amok, or toadying to the powers they're supposed to check? Or just treading water in a turbulent sea of some 2.1 million government workers? Opinions are as different as the thousand-and-one flavors of waste, fraud and abuse.  There are, however, ways to judge the quality of an investigation: how its leaders are chosen, how much independence they have, whether they have the resources and the authority they need and display the will to follow a question to its end.  A guide to Washington's scandal-hunting apparatus:  __  INSPECTORS GENERAL  They mostly do routine reviews that don't much interest the public or the media. But they also investigate things like:  -IRS targeting of tea party groups.  -The Justice Department's \\\"Fast and Furious\\\" gun-trafficking operation.  -An over-the-top Las Vegas conference that led to the resignation of the General Services Administration chief.  -NFL quarterback Michael Vick's dog-fighting ring.  Federal law calls for 73 inspectors general to watch over the work of Cabinet departments, agencies and commissions. They field a staff of about 14,000 auditors, analysts, lawyers and others, including armed criminal investigators. Their budgets total more than $2 billion, according to a 2011 report for Congress.  What do they do?  They investigate crimes such as fraud and bribery by federal workers, contractors and people who abuse the government's services. They call out mismanagement and wasteful spending and recommend better ways to do the public's business. They get tips from whistle-blowers and cases referred by Congress.  Who chooses the inspectors general?  The president nominates them for Cabinet departments and some other prominent agencies, with Senate confirmation. Others are appointed by the leaders of the agencies they investigate. By law, Congress gets 30 days' notice before an IG can be fired. Lawmakers complained that President Barack Obama didn't give notice or an adequate reason when he abruptly fired the AmeriCorps inspector general in 2009.  Pros: IGs report to Congress as well as their agency chief, and their independence is protected by law.  Cons: They are chosen by the administration they will investigate. A president can pick a weak investigator or leave a post unfilled. The State Department slot has been empty for five years, sparking complaints that an office run by a temporary fill-in is less powerful and autonomous.  Government expert Paul Light of New York University says the quality of inspectors general varies greatly. \\\"Some of them are very aggressive,\\\" he said, \\\"and some are very timid.\\\"  Even the hard-chargers tend to stay in the background. That leaves it to lawmakers or the media to spread the word about IG reports, which Light describes as \\\"mind-numbingly difficult to read\\\" and \\\"sleep inducing.\\\"  ___  SPECIAL COUNSELS  They're like superstar IGs.  Unleashing a special counsel automatically pushes a controversy to potential scandal level.  Under Justice Department rules, special counsels are called in to handle potential criminal cases that pose a conflict of interest for the department. They are appointed by the attorney general, who can turn to an outside lawyer or pluck someone from within the department.  The most famous special prosecutor probe: Watergate.  A recent example: Patrick Fitzgerald, then a U.S. attorney in Illinois, investigated George W. Bush administration officials in connection with the leak of covert CIA officer Valerie Plame's identity.  What about Kenneth Starr?  Starr wasn't a special counsel - he was a more powerful \\\"independent counsel\\\" appointed by a panel of three federal judges. Congress created that post after the shock of Watergate, when President Richard Nixon ordered the firing of special prosecutor Archibald Cox in what became known as the \\\"Saturday Night Massacre.\\\"  Congress allowed the independent counsel law to expire in 1999; the special counsel rules took its place.  Independent counsels had come to be seen as out-of-control. Democrats were embittered by the five-year, $70 million investigation, primarily run by Starr, that stretched from President Bill Clinton's Whitewater land deal through his affair with White House intern Monica Lewinsky and its cover-up.  Republicans felt burned by an earlier independent counsel, Lawrence Walsh, who spent six years and $47 million investigating the Reagan administration's secret Iran-Contra operations.  \\\"It was a great mistake to create a power to prosecute without any accountability,\\\" said Lanny Davis, an adviser in the Clinton White House who now specializes in managing political crises. \\\"You don't want the attorney general investigating himself. But you want accountability within the executive branch.\\\"  A special prosecutor, on the other hand, has wide latitude and can only be fired for \\\"good cause.\\\" That's unlikely - firing a special counsel would risk touching off a political storm. The attorney general also holds sway over a special counsel's budget and jurisdiction.  Sen. Lindsey Graham, R-S.C., and a few other Republicans have said a special prosecutor is needed to probe the IRS and the Justice Department's leaks investigations. Attorney General Eric Holder has shown no interest in appointing one.  ___  CONGRESS  No mystery here. If you've heard of a government probe, Congress probably had a hand in it. Lawmakers relish their oversight duties and promote their investigations. The big ones often merit creation of special or select committees and sometimes go on for years.  Some historic probes:  -Hearings on the 2008 financial crisis.  -Iran-Contra hearings.  -Church Committee probe of domestic spying and abuses by the CIA and FBI.  -Senate Watergate Committee.  In addition to the IRS, Benghazi and AP phone records, lawmakers lately have been looking into why Apple Inc. doesn't pay more U.S. taxes, sexual assaults within the military, and the Boston Marathon bombing.  Pros: As a constitutional check on the executive branch, lawmakers wield tremendous power to investigate what they please. They hire expert staff to do the legwork and subpoena witnesses to testify. They also command nearly 3,000 employees at the Government Accountability Office, which audits and analyzes government operations. A congressional hearing done right can rivet the nation's attention.  Cons: When investigations come across as politically motivated attacks, their influence is diminished. Likewise, lawmakers may go too easy on a president from their own party. It's easy to sling reckless charges, even at small fry who get swept into a hearing and besmirched.  ___  THE BLUE RIBBONS  The big ones helped Americans ease calamity into history. They include:  -9/11 Commission on the 2001 terrorist attacks.  -Rogers Commission on the Space Shuttle Challenger disaster.  -Warren Commission on the assassination of President John F. Kennedy.  -Roberts Commission on the Japanese attack on Pearl Harbor.  Lots of blue-ribbon-style commissions are flops, however, too weak or too partisan to command attention or created mostly for show.  Sometimes presidents attempt to head off a more damaging investigation by creating a quick and relatively sympathetic panel, such as Ronald Reagan's Tower Commission on the Iran-Contra scandal, said political scientist Kenneth Kitts, author of \\\"Presidential Commissions & National Security: The Politics of Damage Control.\\\"  \\\"You have to know who is picking these panel members,\\\" he said. \\\"In many cases, if you know who is serving, you can predict how they're going to come out on an issue.\\\"  And independent panels set up at lower levels of government, such as the State Department's commission on the Benghazi attacks, will carry less weight.  At their best, the panels assembled by a president or Congress, or both, are the ultimate investigations - nonpartisan, with the stature and authority to chase down the truth and inspire reform.  Sometimes they're messy. Light, who analyzed the impact of 100 national commissions for an upcoming book, points to the 1981 Greenspan Commission on saving Social Security as an example of success forged through bitter concessions and painful negotiation.  In the end, the type of investigation matters less than the people who carry it out.  \\\"What I tend to see in the ones that work is good leadership and political will,\\\" Light said, \\\"and just plain guts.\\\"  ___  Follow Connie Cass on Twitter: http://www.twitter.com/ConnieCass\",\n      \"sentiment\": -5,\n      \"sentiment_reason\": \"Sentiment set to -5 because the percentage of

As set forth in the indictment I asked a Citizens&rsquo; Grand Jury in Ocala, Fla., to issue on Oct. 29, 2012, Obama and Biden, boasting of their success in killing Osama bin Laden, publicly disclosed that Navy SEAL Team 6 special ops forces were responsible for bin Laden&rsquo;s assassination. This illegal disclosure &ndash; the likes of which never before having occurred with any administration &ndash; put a virtual target on the backs of SEAL Team 6 forces serving in the Afghan theater. Sure enough, just a few months later, on Aug. 6, 2011, a Chinook helicopter carrying 22 SEAL Team 6 members into battle was shot down by Taliban terrorist jihadists in obvious retaliation for the death of bin Laden. In effect, due to the release of the identity of SEAL Team 6, the deaths of these brave servicemen were the result of the crime of &ldquo;involuntary manslaughter&rdquo; by Obama and Biden. They were indicted for these crimes and will be tried in Ocala before a Citizens&rsquo; Court ironically after the July 4 holiday.\",\n      \"sentiment\": -4,\n      \"sentiment_reason\": \"Sentiment set to -4 because the percentage of negative attributes are high and there are negative emotions\",\n      \"feelings\": \"frustrated|1, \",\n      \"emotions\": \"shot|1, battle|1, sure|1, death|1, brave|1, involuntary|1, crime|1, likes|1, illegal|1, indictment|1, attack|1, thwart|1, grand|1, success|1, special|1, killing|1, vice|1, \",\n      \"posterms\": \"enough|1, sure|1, release|1, brave|1, will|1, result|1, responsible|1, special|1, bolster|1, security|1, leading|1, grand|1, success|1, highly|1, \",\n      \"negterms\": \"down|1, death|1, crime|1, involuntary|1, shot|1, battle|1, thwart|1, attack|1, indictment|1, illegal|1, vice|1, \",\n      \"image\": \"\",\n      \"id\": \"51aa025856ae0ecf2f000000\",\n      \"keywords\": \"seal,team,obama,citizens,months,ocala,2012,laden,these,before,biden,forces,president,administration,carrying,2011,helicopter,members,chinook,into,taliban,down,shot,battle,later,just,target,virtual,occurred,having,backs,serving,enough,sure,theater,afghan,terrorist,jihadists,crimes,will,indicted,manslaughter,involuntary,tried,court,holiday,july,after,ironically,crime,result,effect,death,retaliation,obvious,release,identity,servicemen,brave,klayman,deaths,suited,likes,nuclear,iranian,attack,israeli,facilities,branch,forth,elections,executive,leading,thwart,prospects,national,classified,highly,leaked,security,information,re-election,bidens,officials,bolster,indictment,asked,larry,special,political,navy,responsible,ladens,surrogates,disclosure,illegal,assassination,disclosed,publicly,vice,jury,grand,other,issue,boasting,purposes,osama,killing,success,never,\",\n      \"sitetype\": \"Social Network\"\n    },\n    \"sites\": \"www.facebook.com,www.nytimes.com,www.juliosevero.com,www.thenewamerican.com,friendfeed.com,www.canadafreepress.com,www.tpnn.com,politicalanimalblog.com,dailycaller.com,theblacksphere.net,www.bing.com,freakoutnation.com,maddowblog.msnbc.com,www.twitter.com,www.isthatbaloney.com\",\n    \"influencers\": \"deborah wessling|www.facebook.com,paulo pinto|www.juliosevero.com,we survived bush.  you will survive obama.|www.facebook.com,friendfeed|friendfeed.com,gary gevisser|www.facebook.com,justin dr&amp;eacute;w|www.facebook.com,abdullah rehman|www.facebook.com,y&amp;oslash;'boyfu ck's likea ratchetassbish|www.facebook.com,extortion 17 - demand a congressional hearing|politicalanimalblog.com,jeff poor|dailycaller.com,debi grecocanchola|theblacksphere.net,jim treacher|dailycaller.com,doug devillez|www.facebook.com\"\n  }\n}",

With the aid of an old mystic named Vitruvius (Morgan Freeman), a tough young lady named Wyldstyle (Elizabeth Banks),[5] and Batman (Will Arnett), Emmet will fight to defeat the evil tyrant Lord Business (Will Ferrell) who is bent on destroying the Lego universe by gluing it together.[6] Cast[edit]  Chris Pratt as Emmet[6] Will Arnett as Batman[6] Elizabeth Banks as Wyldstyle[6][5] Morgan Freeman as Vitruvius[6] Will Ferrell as President Business/Lord Business[7][5] Liam Neeson as Bad Cop/Good Cop[7][5] Nick Offerman as Metal Beard[7] Jonah Hill as Green Lantern[8] Cobie Smulders as Wonder Woman[8] Channing Tatum as Superman[8] Charlie Day as Spaceman Benny[5] Alison Brie as Uni-Kitty[7][9]  Production[edit]               Creators of the film at the 2013 San Diego Comic-Con International: Phil Lord and Chris Miller, writers and directors; Chris McKay, co-director; and Dan Lin, producer.   The film has been in development at Warner Bros. since 2008.[10] In August 2009, it was announced that Dan and Kevin Hageman were writing the script for a comedy action adventure live-action/animated film.[11] Cloudy with a Chance of Meatballs directors Phil Lord and Chris Miller were hired in June 2010, to write and direct the film.[12] In November 2011, it was reported that Warner Bros. had green-lit the film, with a schedule to release it in 2014. Australian Animal Logic will provide the animation, which is expected to comprise 80% of the film. Chris McKay, the director of Robot Chicken, has also joined Lord and Miller to co-direct the film.[10] In March 2012, Lord and Miller revealed its working title, Lego: The Piece of Resistance, and a storyline: \\\"It involves many worlds. Basically, the least qualified Lego characters in the universe having to keep the world from being frozen together.\\\"[13] In April 2012, Warner Bros. scheduled the film for February 28, 2014.[14] The first cast was reported in June 2012, with Chris Pratt voicing Emmet, the lead Lego character, and Will Arnett voicing Lego Batman; while the role of Lego Superman has been offered to Channing Tatum.[15] In August 2012, it was revealed that Elizabeth Banks will voice \\\"tough-as-nails\\\" Lucy (later renamed Wyldstyle)[5] and Morgan Freeman will lend his voice to Vitruvius, an old mystic.[16] The film will tell a story of Emmet, an ordinary, law-abiding, Lego minifigure, who is mistaken for the most extraordinary Master Builder. He is drafted into a fellowship of strangers including Vitruvius, Wyldstyle and Batman, on a quest to stop an evil tyrant from gluing the universe together.[15][16] In October 2012, Warner Bros. shifted the release date for the film, simply titled Lego, to February 7, 2014.[17] On November 2012, Alison Brie, Will Ferrell, Liam Neeson and Nick Offerman have signed on for roles. Brie will voice a member of Emmet's team with a powerful secret, Ferrell will play a villain named President Business, Neeson will play a foe called Bad Cop, and Offerman will play Metal Beard,[18] a pirate seeking revenge on the President.[19] On March 21, 2013, it was announced the name of the movie would be \\\"The Lego Movie\\\".[20] Since July 2012, a contest has been running on the official Facebook page, which will enable the winning Lego vehicle to appear in the film.[21] 17 Lego building sets based on the film's scenes and characters will be released,[22] including Lord Business' Evil Lair,[23] and Cloud Cuckoo Palace,[9] along with a new set of 16 Minifigures (William Shakespeare, Gail the Construction Worker, Panda Guy, Abraham Lincoln, Taco Tuesday Guy, Larry the Barista, President Business, Calamity Drone, Marsha Queen of the Mermaids, Wild West Wyldstyle, Scribbe-Face Bad Cop, Velma Staplebot, Hard Hat Emmet, \\\"Where are my Pants?\\\" Guy, Mrs. Scratchen-Post and Wiley Fusebot).[24][22] Miller's personal Lego set from his childhood, Space Village, will be utilized in the film.[25] Release[edit] The Lego Movie is scheduled to be released on February 7, 2014. The first teaser/theatrical trailer was released on June 18, 2013.[26] The second was released on October 30, 2013, preceded by a series of teasers featuring main characters.[27] Video game[edit] A video game based on the movie, The Lego Movie Videogame, is being developed by TT Games for Xbox 360, Xbox One, PlayStation 3, PlayStation 4, Wii U, Nintendo 3DS, PlayStation Vita and Windows, to be released alongside the film in 2014.[28] References[edit]   ^ Name. \\\"LEGO: THE PIECE OF RESISTANCE Moves up to February 7, 2014 | Collider | Page 205471\\\".

(July 2012)              Re-enactment of the crucifixion   The Holy Land Experience (HLE) is a Christian theme park in Orlando, Florida and registered non-profit corporation. HLE conducts weekly church services and bible studies for the general public. HLEs theme park recreates the architecture and themes of the ancient city of Jerusalem in 1st century Israel. The Holy Land Experience is owned by the Trinity Broadcasting Network. Jan Crouch is Director and CEO.

Ivanov founded both the Holy Land Experience and Zion's Hope, which funded the park's initial construction. The park opened in February 2001. The Jewish Defense League protested at the Holy Land Experience on its opening day; the group claimed that the purpose of the park was to convert Jews to Christianity, although Ivanov denied these claims.[2] The Scriptorium: Center for Biblical Antiquities[edit] On August 17, 2002, the Holy Land Experience Scriptorium museum opened. It features the Van Kampen Collection of biblically related artifacts. The collection includes ancient scrolls, manuscripts, and early printed editions of the Bible. The collection is the fourth largest of its kind. The Van Kampen Collection was founded in 1986 by Robert and Judith Van Kampen. In 1994 Robert Van Kampen established a privately funded research library for the purpose of presenting the collection to the academic community as well as the general public. The Scriptorium: Center for Christian Antiquities, located in Grand Haven, MI, housed the Collection. In 2002, the Collection relocated to Orlando, where it is on loan to the Holy Land Experience.[3] Trinity Broadcasting Network ownership[edit] Main article: Trinity Broadcasting Network In June 2007, the Holy Land Experience Board of Directors sold the property to the Trinity Broadcasting Network (TBN), for an estimated $37 million. The property was an estimated $8 million in debt at the time of the sale.[4] A that time TBN planned to update the park and use the property to build a Central Florida broadcasting facility, and a movie studio in order to produce Christian films. On August 21, 2007, former president and board member, Tom Powell, resigned his position to seek \\\"new challenges.\\\" Four people remained on the park's board: Paul Crouch Sr., Jan Crouch, Paul Crouch Jr., and Matthew Crouch.[5] Between 50 and 100 employees lost their jobs when they were cut from the payroll in October 2007.[4] Under TBNs ownership, The Holy Land Experience underwent construction and the addition of new landscaping, exhibits, restaurants, and theaters which feature live musical and theatrical productions.[6] The park has also introduced weekly bible studies, church services and live cooking demonstrations. The Smile of a Child Adventure Land was added to the park exhibits. This childrens park features exhibits and activities for children, such as a wilderness rock-climbing wall, toy store, childrens theater and craft center. Holy Land Experience mission statement[edit] HLE is a non-denominational Christian theme park and church. Church services and bible studies are conducted by ordained pastors for the general public on a weekly basis. HLE is registered as a non-profit corporation with the Florida Department of State Division of Corporations.[7] Church of All Nations[edit] In 2012, the 2,000 seat Church of All Nations auditorium opened. The facility features live presentations and reenactments of the passion and crucifixion of Jesus Christ, and the depiction of the resurrection and ascension of Jesus Christ to heaven. Live taping of TBNs flagship TV show, Praise the Lord, are also taped in this facility, in addition to concerts and church services. Exhibits[edit] There are approximately 40 exhibits in the park, including several restaurants and retail shops.[8][9]  Main entrance/City Gate: A stone arch modeled after the Damascus Gate and Jaffa Gate of Jerusalem.   Jerusalem Street Market: A Middle Eastern marketplace, with city well, and street merchants who interact with guests.   The Old Scroll Shop: An example of 1st century shopping.   Wilderness Tabernacle: A High Priest describes Israels ancient priesthood, culminating with the Ark of the Covenant.   Church of All Nations Prayer Garden: Based on the Church of All Nations built in 1924 by the Catholic Church on the Mount of Olives in Jerusalem. The traditional church depicts a section of bedrock where Jesus is said to have prayed before his arrest.   Dead Sea Qumran Caves: Replica of the desert caves where the Dead Sea Scrolls were discovered.   The Judean Village: Outdoor vignette stage for dramas and musicals.   Calvarys Garden Tomb: A replica of the Garden Tomb where Jesus body was laid to rest.   Oasis Palms Caf: A cafe with an authentic Middle Eastern atmosphere.   Temple Plaza: A six story, white and gold temple, which was the center of Jerusalems religious life, serves as a backdrop for the Temple Plaza. It hosts live musicals, presentations, and events.   Last Supper Communion: Guests may partake of the last supper with Jesus and disciples.   Jerusalem Model 66 A.D.: The worlds largest indoor model of Jerusalem. Presentations explain the citys landmarks and Christs final days in Jerusalem.   The Shofar Shop: A gift shop.   Shofar Auditorium: A state-of-the-art venue for dramas, musicals, and presentations.   The Scriptorium: A presentation of the history of the Bible, including authentic, ancient artifacts from around the world.   Living Word Prayer Garden: Gardens for resting, reflecting and praying.   Crystal Living Waters: A dancing waters presentation.   The Jesus Boat: Replica of a boat found in the Sea of Galilee, dating back to the time of Christ.  Tax status[edit] There was a four-year legal fight concerning almost $1,000,000 in property taxes that Orange County Property Appraiser Bill Donegan alleged were owed. Donnegan argued that the Holy Land Experience is a theme park. Donegan dropped his fight after state lawmakers passed a law in 2006 granting a tax exemption for theme parks that display, exhibit, illustrate and interpret biblical manuscripts. This is similar to the tax exemption for museums that present historical information on other subjects. The law prevented Orange County from collecting the alleged back taxes as well as forgiving the park $300,000 in yearly property taxes. The law requires the park to offer an annual free admissions day.[10][11] See also[edit]  Holy Land USA, a similar park in Connecticut. (now closed)  References[edit]   ^ Davis, James D.

While considered a novel approach by some, it has raised controversy amongst enthusiasts and collectors, increasing the amount of difficulty in obtaining a complete collection[citation needed]. Purchases from many retailers make no guarantees regarding the contents of a particular package. Despite attempts to obfuscate the contents of these packages, the bags of Series 1 and 2 have a second figurine-specific bar code on the rear of the packaging, next to the EAN/UPC product bar code (which is unique to each series). This has allowed customers to identify individual figures within the packaging, significantly decreasing the amount of money and effort required to obtain a complete collection, and eliminates the possibility of unintentionally receiving duplicates.[2] There are also apps for both iPhone and Android devices that utilize these bar codes.[3] Lego has eliminated the figurine-specific bar codes on all Series 3 and 4 packages and replaced them with a braille-like system of dots embossed in the lower seal of the bag. In theory, this will allow customers to continue identifying the figure enclosed within.[4][5] Later series do not have any markings to indicate their contents. On average a new mini fig series has been released every 4 months. Release dates sometimes vary between countries. The most recent series was Series 11, which was released on September 1st, 2013 in the United States.

It is owned by The Walt Disney Company through its division Walt Disney Parks and Resorts. The property covers 30,080 acres (12,173ha; 47sqmi), in which it houses 24 themed resorts, four theme parks, two water parks, and several additional recreational and entertainment venues. Magic Kingdom is the original theme park on the complex, and Epcot, Disney's Hollywood Studios, and Disney's Animal Kingdom opened throughout the 1980s and 1990s. Designed to supplement Disneyland in Anaheim, California, which had opened in 1955, Walt Disney developed the complex in the 1960s, though he died in 1966 before construction on \\\"The Florida Project\\\" began. After extensive lobbying, the Government of Florida created the Reedy Creek Improvement District, a special government district that essentially gave The Walt Disney Company the standard powers and autonomy of an incorporated city. Original plans called for the inclusion of an \\\"Experimental Prototype Community of Tomorrow\\\", a planned city that would serve as a test bed for new innovations for city living.

Market surveys revealed that only 5% of Disneyland's visitors came from east of the Mississippi River, where 75% of the population of the United States lived. Additionally, Walt Disney disliked the businesses that had sprung up around Disneyland and wanted control of a much larger area of land for the new project.[1] Walt Disney flew over the Orlando-area site (one of many) in November 1963. Seeing the well-developed network of roads, including the planned Interstate 4 and Florida's Turnpike, with McCoy Air Force Base (later Orlando International Airport) to the east, Disney selected a centrally located site near Bay Lake.[2] To avoid a burst of land speculation, Disney used various dummy corporations to acquire 27,443 acres (11,106ha) of land.[2] In May 1965, some of these major land transactions were recorded a few miles southwest of Orlando in Osceola County. Also, two large tracts totaling $1.5 million were sold, and smaller tracts of flatlands and cattle pastures were purchased by exotic-sounding companies such as the Latin-American Development and Management Corporation and the Reedy Creek Ranch Corporation (Some of these names are now memorialized on a window above Main Street, U.S.A. in the Magic Kingdom). In addition to three huge parcels of land were many smaller parcels, referred to as \\\"outs.\\\" Much of the land acquired had been platted into 5-acre (2ha) lots in 1912 by the Munger Land Company and sold to investors. Most owners were happy to get rid of the land, which was mostly swamp. Another issue was the mineral rights to the land, which were owned by Tufts University. Without the transfer of these rights, Tufts could come in at any time and demand the removal of buildings to obtain minerals. Eventually, Disney's team negotiated a deal with Tufts to buy the mineral rights for $15,000.[3] After most of the land had been bought, the truth of the property's owner was leaked to the Orlando Sentinel newspaper on October 20, 1965. A press conference was organized for November 15, when Walt Disney explained the plans for the site, including EPCOT, the Experimental Prototype Community of Tomorrow, which was to be a futuristic planned city (and which was also known as Progress City). He envisioned a working city with commercial and residential areas that also continued to showcase and test new ideas and concepts for urban living. Walt Disney died from lung cancer on December 15, 1966, before his vision was realized. His brother and business partner, Roy O. Disney, postponed his retirement to oversee construction of the resort's first phase. On February 2, 1967, Roy O. Disney held a press conference at the Park Theatres in Winter Park, Florida. The role of EPCOT was emphasized in the film that was played, the last one recorded by Walt Disney before his death. After the film, it was explained that for Disney World, including EPCOT, to succeed, a special district would have to be formed: the Reedy Creek Improvement District with two cities inside it, Bay Lake and Reedy Creek (now Lake Buena Vista). In addition to the standard powers of an incorporated city, which include the issuance of tax-free bonds, the district would have immunity from any current or future county or state land-use laws. The only areas where the district had to submit to the county and state would be property taxes and elevator inspections.[1] The legislation forming the district and the two cities was signed into law by Florida Governor Claude R. Kirk, Jr. on May 12, 1967. The Florida Supreme Court then ruled in 1968 that the district was allowed to issue tax-exempt bonds for public projects within the district despite the sole beneficiary being Walt Disney Productions. The district soon began construction of drainage canals, and Disney built the first roads and Magic Kingdom. The Contemporary Resort Hotel, the Polynesian Village, and Fort Wilderness were also completed in time for the park's opening on October 1, 1971. The Palm and Magnolia golf courses near Magic Kingdom had opened a few weeks before. At the park's opening, Roy O. Disney dedicated the property and declared that it would be known as \\\"Walt Disney World\\\" in his brother's honor. In his own words: \\\"Everyone has heard of Ford cars. But have they all heard of Henry Ford, who started it all? Walt Disney World is in memory of the man who started it all, so people will know his name as long as Walt Disney World is here.\\\" After the dedication, Roy Disney asked Walt's widow, Lillian, what she thought of Walt Disney World. According to biographer Bob Thomas, she responded, \\\"I think Walt would have approved.\\\" Roy O. Disney died on December 20, 1971, less than three months after the property opened. Much of Walt Disney's plans for his Progress City were abandoned after his death, after the company board decided that it did not want to be in the business of running a city. The concept evolved into the resort's second theme park, EPCOT Center (renamed Epcot in 1996), which opened in 1982. While still emulating Walt Disney's original idea of showcasing new technology, it is closer to a world's fair than a \\\"community of tomorrow\\\". Some of the urban planning concepts from the original idea of EPCOT would instead be integrated into the community of Celebration much later. The resort's third theme park, Disney-MGM Studios (renamed Disney's Hollywood Studios in 2008), opened in 1989, and is inspired by show business. The resort's fourth theme park, Disney's Animal Kingdom, opened in 1998. George Kalogridis was named president of the resort in December 2012, replacing Meg Crofton, who had overseen the site since 2006. Timeline[edit]     Walt Disney (left) with his brother Roy O.

One of four arches welcoming guests to the resort.   Despite marketing claims and popular misconceptions, the Florida resort is not within Orlando city limits, but is actually about 21 miles (34km) southwest of downtown Orlando, much of it in southwestern Orange County, with the remainder in adjacent Osceola County. The property includes the cities of Lake Buena Vista and Bay Lake which are governed by the Reedy Creek Improvement District. The 25,000 acres (10,117ha; 39sqmi)[4] site is accessible from Central Florida's Interstate 4 via Exits 62B (World Drive), 64B (US 192 West), 65B (Osceola Parkway West), 67B (SR 536 West), and 68 (SR 535 North), and Exit 8 on State Road 429 (Florida), the Western Expressway. At its peak, the resort occupied approximately 30,000 acres (12,141ha; 47sqmi), about the size of San Francisco, or twice the size of Manhattan. Portions of the property since have been sold or de-annexed, including land now occupied by the Disney-built community of Celebration.

The four 18-hole golf courses are the Palm (4 Stars), the Magnolia (4 Stars), Lake Buena Vista (4 Stars) and Osprey Ridge (4 Stars). There is also a nine-hole walking course (no electric carts allowed) called Oak Trail, designed for young golfers. The Magnolia and Palm courses play home to the PGA Tour's Children's Miracle Network Hospitals Classic. Arnold Palmer Golf Management manages the Disney golf courses.[5] Additionally, there are two themed miniature golf complexes, each with two courses, Fantasia Gardens and Winter Summerland. Catch-and-release fishing excursions are offered daily on the resort's lakes. A Florida fishing license is not required because it occurs on private property. Cane-pole fishing is offered from the docks at Disney's Fort Wilderness Resort & Campground and Disney's Port Orleans Resort. Additional recreational activities include watercraft rentals, surrey bike rentals, and firework cruises that launch from several resort marinas. Former attractions[edit]  Disney's River Country: The first water park at the Walt Disney World Resort. It opened on June 20, 1976 and closed on November 1, 2001. Discovery Island: An island in Bay Lake which was home to many species of animals and birds. It opened on April 8, 1974 and closed on April 8, 1999.  Resorts[edit] Of the thirty-four resorts and hotels on the Walt Disney World property, twenty-four are owned and operated by Walt Disney Parks and Resorts. These are classified into four categories: Deluxe, Moderate, Value, and Disney Vacation Club Villas, and are located in one of five resort areas: the Magic Kingdom, Epcot, Disney's Hollywood Studios, Animal Kingdom, or Downtown Disney resort areas.

In February 2008, Disney submitted plans to the South Florida Water Management District to replace the 60 existing villas with 60 new villas.[7] The Treehouse Villas opened during the summer of 2009.

Today it employs more than 66,000, spending more than $1.2 billion on payroll and $474 million on benefits each year. The largest single-site employer in the United States,[8] Walt Disney World has more than 3,700 job classifications. The resort also sponsors and operates the Walt Disney World College Program, an internship program that offers American college students (CP's) the opportunity to live about 15 miles (24km) off site in 4 Disney-owned apartment complexes and work at the resort, providing much of the theme park and resort \\\"front line\\\" cast members. There is also the Walt Disney World International College Program, an internship program that offers International college students (ICP's) from all over the world the same opportunity. Maintenance[edit] In a March 30, 2004 article in The Orlando Sentinel, then-Walt Disney World president Al Weiss gave some insight into how the parks are maintained:  More than 5,000 cast members are dedicated to maintenance and engineering, including 750 horticulturists and 600 painters. Disney spends more than $100 million every year on maintenance at the Magic Kingdom. In 2003, $6 million was spent on renovating its Crystal Palace restaurant. 90 percent of guests say that the upkeep and cleanliness of the Magic Kingdom are excellent or very good. The streets in the parks are steam cleaned every night. There are cast members permanently assigned to painting the antique carousel horses; they use genuine gold leaf. There is a tree farm on site so that when a mature tree needs to be replaced, a thirty-year-old tree will be available to replace it.  Transportation[edit]     A Disney bus, one of the transportation modes within Walt Disney World   A fleet of Disney-operated buses on property, branded Disney Transport, is complimentary for guests. In 2007, Disney Transport started a guest services upgrade to the buses. SatellGPS systems controlling new public address systems on the buses give safety information, park tips and other general announcements, with music. They are not to be confused with the Disney Cruise Line and Disney's Magical Express buses, which are operated by Mears Transportation. The Walt Disney World Monorail System also provides transportation at Walt Disney World. They operate on three routes that interconnect at the Transportation and Ticket Center (TTC), adjacent to the Magic Kingdom's parking lot. One line provides an express non-stop link from the TTC to the Magic Kingdom, while a second line provides a link from the TTC to Epcot. The third line links the TTC and the Magic Kingdom to the Contemporary, Polynesian, and Grand Floridian resorts. Disney Transport also operates a fleet of watercraft, ranging in size from water taxis up to the ferries that connect the Magic Kingdom to the Transportation and Ticket Center. The major roads within the resort (World Drive, Osceola Parkway and Epcot Center Drive) have segments that are built as freeways with full grade-separated interchanges. World Drive enters Walt Disney World from U.S. Route 192 and heads north to the Magic Kingdom Resort Area. Osceola Parkway heads east from the Animal Kingdom Resort Area to Interstate 4. Epcot Center Drive is a freeway for most of its route, running east from World Drive, past the Epcot parking lot to Interstate 4. Buena Vista Drive is a major surface street, running east from the Animal Kingdom Resort Area to Disney's Hollywood Studios, the Epcot Resort Area, and Downtown Disney. Name and logo[edit] During the resort's early planning stages, Walt Disney referred to the project as Project X, The Florida Project, Disney World, and The Disney World. Early visual references used the same medieval font as Disneyland. Walt Disney was very involved in the site selection and project planning in the years before his death. The secretive names were chosen because of the high confidentiality of the project during the initial planning. After Walt Disney's death, Roy O. Disney added the name Walt to Disney World as a permanent tribute to his brother. The original logo had an over-sized \\\"D\\\" with a Mickey Mouse-shaped globe containing latitude and longitude lines, with the property's name presented in a modern, sans-serif font. It was retired during its 25th anniversary celebration in 199697, but can still be found in many places, including the SpectroMagic title float, the front car of each monorail, manhole covers, survey markers, select merchandise items and flags flown at several sites across the property. Twin town[edit] As part of a competition run by Disney for 2010, Walt Disney World has an unofficial twinning (sister city) with Swindon, England, since 2009.[9][10] Rebecca Warren's submission to the competition granted Swindon to be the twin town of Walt Disney World, which is famous for its intersection with six roundabouts. Warren and the mayor of Swindon were invited to a \\\"twinning\\\" ceremony, where a plaque revealing the connection will be placed.[11] See also[edit]  Incidents at Walt Disney World Resort Walt Disney Travel Company, Incorporated Walt Disney World Casting Center Walt Disney World College Program Walt Disney World Company Walt Disney World Explorer Walt Disney World Hospitality and Recreation Corporation Walt Disney World International Program  References[edit]   ^ a b Fogleson, Richard E.

The announcement stated that it would be a \\\"natural\\\" park and revealed the park's iconic Dolphin Plunge water slides.[1] On March 5, 2007, SeaWorld held a press conference officially announcing Aquatica.[2] It was expected the 59-acre (24ha) park would cost US$50 million to build.[2] Construction continued in earnest throughout 2007 and into early 2008. Previews for employees and holders of park annual passes were held in February. On March 1, 2008, the park opened to guests for the first time, with the official grand opening held on April 4, 2008.[3] In its debut year, the park hosted approximately 950,000 guests, making it the fourth-most visited water park in the United States and eighth-most visited in the world.[4] The park was an immediate success, reaching its opening-year attendance goal in just six months.[4] In early 2011, rumors speculated about Aquatica coming to SeaWorld San Antonio in the future. According to the park president, SeaWorld San Antonio would become a multi-day experience.[5] SeaWorld officially announced plans to build a water park on May 24, 2011. The announcement called it, \\\"a whimsical waterpark with up-close animal experiences, high-speed thrills and relaxing, sandy beaches\\\".[6] The water park replaced Lost Lagoon that opened in the early 1990s. Lost Lagoon closed on Labor Day weekend 2011. During October 2011 the construction of the new water park started with excavation for the new entrance, the new sandy beaches, and the structure for the new Wahalla Wave water slide. In early November 2011 the new water slides arrived in pieces at Sea World San Antonio's parking lot, waiting to get assembled.[7] Aquatica San Antonio officially opened on May 19, 2012.[8] On November 20, 2012, Cedar Fair announced it had sold its San Diego Soak City park to SeaWorld Parks & Entertainment.[9] The water park originally opened on May 31, 1997, under the name White Water Canyon. At the time it featured 16 water slides and a wave pool.[10] In December 1999, Cedar Fair purchased the park for $11.5 million and renamed it Knott's Soak City U.S.A..[11] The water park had opened with a new beach theme in May 2000.[12] The acquisition by SeaWorld Parks & Entertainment will see the park transformed into a 32-acre (13ha) water park named Aquatica San Diego. The refurbished park reopened on June 1, 2013.[9][13] Locations[edit]   Park name Location Coordinates Opening date Ref.

Headquartered in Boston's Back Bay, it publishes textbooks, instructional technology materials, assessments, reference works, and fiction and non-fiction for both young readers and adults.

History[edit] In 1832, William Ticknor and James Thomas Fields had gathered an impressive list of writers, including Ralph Waldo Emerson, Nathaniel Hawthorne, and Henry David Thoreau. The duo formed a close relationship with Riverside Press, a Boston printing company owned by Henry Oscar Houghton. Shortly after, Houghton also founded a publishing company with partner George Mifflin. In 1880, Ticknor and Fields and Houghton and Mifflin merged their operations, combining the literary works of writers with the expertise of a publisher and creating a new partnership named Houghton, Mifflin and Company. The company still had debt from when it merged from Houghton, Osgood and Company, so it decided to add partners. In 1884, James D. Hurd, the son of Melancthon Hurd became a partner. Three people in 1888 became partners as well: James Murray Kay, Thurlow Weed Barnes, and Henry Oscar Houghton, Jr. Shortly thereafter the company established an Educational Department, and from 1891 to 1908 sales of educational materials increased by 500 percent. Soon after 1916, Houghton Mifflin became involved in publishing standardized tests and testing materials, working closely with such test developers as E.F. Lindquist. The company was the fourth-largest educational publisher in the United States in 1921. In 1961, Houghton Mifflin famously passed on Julia Child's Mastering the Art of French Cooking, giving it up to Alfred A. Knopf who later published it in 1962. It went on to become an overnight success and is considered by many to be the bible of French cooking. Houghton Mifflin's strategic error was depicted in the 2009 film Julie & Julia.[unreliable source?] In 1967, Houghton Mifflin became a publicly traded company on the New York Stock Exchange under the stock symbol HTN. The company is currently privately held and no longer trades under this symbol. Under (new from 1991) president Nader F. Darehshori Houghton Mifflin acquired in 1994 for $138 million[3] McDougal Littell, an educational publisher of secondary school materials, and in following year D.C. Heath and Company,[4] a publisher of supplemental educational resources. In 1996, the company created their Great Source Education Group to combine the supplemental material product lines of their School Division and these two companies. Creation of Houghton Mifflin Harcourt[edit] Mergers and acquisitions (M&A) activities have had major effects on this company. Vivendi purchase[edit] In 2001, Houghton Mifflin was acquired by French media giant Vivendi Universal for $2.2 billion including assumed debt. In 2002, facing mounting financial and legal pressures, Vivendi sold Houghton to private equity investors Thomas H. Lee Partners, Bain Capital, and Blackstone Group for $1.66 billion, including assumed debt (approximately 25% less than Vivendi had paid a year earlier).[5][6] Riverdeep merger with Houghton Mifflin[edit] On December 22, 2006, it was announced that Riverdeep PLC had completed its acquisition of Houghton Mifflin. The new joint enterprise would be called the Houghton Mifflin Riverdeep Group. Riverdeep paid $1.75 billion in cash and assumed $1.61 billion in debt from the private investment firms Thomas H. Lee Partners, Bain Capital and Blackstone Group.[7] Tony Lucki, a former non-executive director of Riverdeep, remained in his position as the company's chief executive officer until April 2009.[8] Houghton Mifflin sold its professional testing unit, Promissor, to Pearson plc in 2006. The company combined its remaining assessment products within Riverside Publishing, including San Francisco-based Edusoft. Harcourt merger[edit] On July 16, 2007 Houghton Mifflin Riverdeep announced that it signed a definitive agreement to acquire the Harcourt Education, Harcourt Trade and Greenwood-Heinemann divisions of Reed Elsevier for $4 billion. The expanded company would become Houghton Mifflin Harcourt. McDougal Littell was merged with Harcourt's Holt, Rinehart & Winston to form Holt McDougal On December 3, 2007, Cengage Learning (formerly Thomson Learning) announced that it had agreed to acquire the assets of the Houghton Mifflin College Division for $750 million, pending regulatory approval. On November 25, 2008, Houghton Mifflin Harcourt announced a temporary freeze on acquisition of new trade division titles, allegedly in response to the economic crisis of 2008.[9] The publisher of the trade division resigned, apparently in protest.[10] Many observers familiar with the publishing industry saw the move as a devastating blunder.[11][12] Harcourt Religion was sold to Our Sunday Visitor in 2009 [13] Houghton Mifflin Harcourt restructuring[edit] On July 27, 2009, the Irish Independent newspaper reported that Houghton Mifflin Harcourt's controlling shareholder EMPG was in the process of a re-structuring negotiations with its unsecured-debt holders that would lead to the conversion of the debt into equity. The news story reported that the unsecured debt holders would receive a 45% equity stake. As a result, the royal family of Dubai via their Istithmar World Capital investment vehicle became major stakeholders.[14] Estimates were that EMPG would cut its debt from $7.3bn to $6.1bn. On August 15, 2009, the Financial Times newspaper reported in an interview with Houghton Mifflin Harcourt's CEO at the time, Barry O'Callaghan, that the refinancing had received approval of more than 90% of lenders. The terms included the holding company debt converting into 45% of the fully diluted common equity, an effective 25 per cent relaxation of financial covenants, second lien lenders agreeing to convert their holdings into a PIK instrument, reducing annual interest costs by $100m, and a further $50m increase its working capital facility.[15] Second round restructuring[edit] A further restructuring of Houghton Mifflin Harcourt's debts was confirmed by the company on 13 January 2010.[16] The proposed restructuring materially impacted the shareholders of EMPG, the former holding company of Houghton Mifflin Harcourt.[17] Recapitalization in 2010[edit] On 22 February 2010, Houghton Mifflin Harcourt announced that EMPG and HMH had reached an agreement to restructure the finances of the company and recapitalize its balance sheet with a substantial fresh cash investment by institutional investors.[18] The agreement, supported by 100% of HMH's creditors, highlighted a reduction in the senior debt to $3 billion from the current $5 billion, with new equity issued to the senior debt holders (including Paulson & Co. and Guggenheim Partners),[19] conversion of the $2 billion mezzanine debt into equity and warrant, receipt of $650m of new cash from the sale of new equity. In addition to the key highlights, HMH announced its new $100m Innovation Fund, to invest in the next generation of technology for the education industry. The Irish Times[20] reported that the investments by the then equity holders of EMPG, including HMH's CEO at the time, Barry O'Callaghan, private clients of Davy Stockbrokers, Reed Elsevier, and others of over $3.5 billion would be written down to zero. Additionally, the Irish Independent reported that following the restructuring, the investors of EMPG would have a nominal investment in Houghton Mifflin Harcourt via warrants over 5% of the company if it exceeded the $10 billion valuation[21] placed on the company at the time of the merger between Houghton Mifflin Riverdeep and Harcourt. In addition to the warrants in HMH, the EMPG shareholders would continue to own a stake in the international investment vehicle, EMPGI which has stakes in China, the Middle East and elsewhere. The Financial Times reported[22] that no management changes were expected as part of the deal with both the CEO at the time, Barry O'Callaghan and the CFO, Michael Muldowney expected to remain in their roles. The Times reported that a new nine-member board was to be created with the CEO the only executive representative, one independent, two representative of Paulson & Co, and one director from each of Apollo, BlackRock, Guggenheim Partners, Fidelity and Avenue Capital. On 10 March 2010, Houghton Mifflin Harcourt announced that it had completed its re-capitalization.[23] In addition to a new investment of $ 650 million of equity, the debt levels of the company were reduced by approximately 60% and the annual interest payments by over 75%. According the Irish State Broadcaster, RTE, the old equity investors based in Ireland has lost all their investment.[24] The Irish Independent reported that the old shareholders were denied a shareholders meeting to vote or discuss the restructuring.[25] The former shareholders have been left with warrants over 5% of the company, in the case its value recovers to previous levels. On 19 September 2011, it was announced that Linda K. Zecher would be replacing Barry O'Callahan as Chief Executive Officer and Director of Houghton Mifflin Harcourt after O'Callahan resigned. Zecher went to HMH from Microsoft. She currently works in the corporate headquarters in Boston.[citation needed] Awards and accolades[edit] Curious George At the Zoo was rated a Top Ten app under the Education Games category for the iPad, iPhone and iPod Touch in 2012.[26] Go George Go!, a mobile app for preschoolers, received the Editor's Choice Award from the Children's Technology Review in 2011.[27] Go Math!, a K6 product, was named a Reader's Choice Top 100 product by District Administration in 2010.[28]  Criticism and controversies[edit] The company was ranked the 10th worst place to work in America, according to a glassdoor.com survey in 2009.[29] References[edit]   ^ \\\"Pronunciation Guide.\\\" Houghton Mifflin.

He was killed by Indian agency police on the Standing Rock Indian Reservation during an attempt to arrest him at a time when authorities feared that he would join the Ghost Dance movement.[3] Before the Battle of the Little Bighorn, Sitting Bull had a vision in which he saw the defeat of the 7th Cavalry under Lt. Col. George Armstrong Custer on June 25, 1876. Sitting Bull's leadership motivated his people to a major victory. Months after their victory at the battle, Sitting Bull and his group left the United States for Wood Mountain, Saskatchewan, where he remained until 1881, at which time he surrendered to U.S. forces. A small remnant of his band under Chief Wabl  decided to stay at Wood Mountain. After working as a performer, Sitting Bull returned to the Standing Rock Agency in South Dakota. Because of fears that he would use his influence to support the Ghost Dance movement, Indian Service agent James McLaughlin at Fort Yates ordered his arrest. During an ensuing struggle between Sitting Bull's followers and the agency police, Sitting Bull was shot in the side and head by Standing Rock policemen Lieutenant Bull Head (Tatankapah) and Red Tomahawk (Marcelus Chankpidutah) after the police were fired upon by Sitting Bull's supporters. His body was taken to nearby Fort Yates for burial, but in 1953, his remains were possibly exhumed and reburied near Mobridge, South Dakota, by his Lakota family, who wanted his body to be nearer to his birthplace.

Despite being embroiled in the American Civil War, the United States Army retaliated in 1863 and 1864, even against bands which had not been involved in the hostilities.[8] In 1864, two brigades of about 2200 soldiers under Brigadier General Alfred Sully attacked a village. The defenders were led by Sitting Bull, Gall and Inkpaduta.[8] The Sioux were driven out, but skirmishing continued into August.[citation needed] In September, Sitting Bull and about 100 Hunkpapa Sioux came across a small party near what is now Marmarth, North Dakota. They had been left behind by a wagon train commanded by Captain James L. Fisk to effect some repairs to an overturned wagon. When he led an attack, Sitting Bull was shot in the left hip by a soldier.[8] The bullet exited out through the small of his back, and the wound was not too serious.[9] Red Cloud's War[edit] Sitting Bull led numerous war parties against Fort Berthold, Fort Stevenson, and Fort Buford and their environs from 1865 through 1868.[10] Although Red Cloud was a leader of the Oglala Sioux, his leadership and attacks against forts in the Powder River Country of Montana were supported by Sitting Bull's guerrilla attacks on emigrant parties and smaller forts throughout the upper Missouri River region.[citation needed] By early 1868, the U.S. government desired a peaceful settlement to Red Cloud's War. It agreed to Red Cloud's demands that Forts Phil Kearny and C.F. Smith be abandoned. Chief Gall of the Hunkpapas (among other representatives of the Hunkpapas, Blackfeet, and Yankton Sioux) signed a form of the Treaty of Fort Laramie on July 2, 1868 at Fort Rice (near Bismarck, North Dakota).[11] Sitting Bull did not agree to the treaty. He continued his hit-and-run attacks on forts in the upper Missouri area throughout the late 1860s and early 1870s.[12] The events of 1868 mark a historically debated period of Sitting Bull's life. According to historian Stanley Vestal, who conducted interviews with surviving Hunkpapa in 1930, Sitting Bull was made \\\"Supreme Chief of the whole Sioux Nation\\\" at this time. Later historians and ethnologists have refuted this concept of authority, as the Lakota society was highly decentralised. Lakota bands and their elders made individual decisions.[13] The Great Sioux War of 1876[edit] For more details on this topic, see Great Sioux War of 1876.     Early Cabinet card of Sitting Bull, 1881.   Sitting Bull's band of Hunkpapa continued to attack migrating parties and forts in the late 1860s. When in 1871 the Northern Pacific Railway conducted a survey for a route across the northern plains directly through Hunkpapa lands, it encountered stiff Sioux resistance.[14] The same railway people returned the following year accompanied by federal troops. Sitting Bull and the Hunkpapa attacked the survey party, which was forced to turn back.[15] In 1873, the military accompaniment for the surveyors was increased again, but Sitting Bull's forces resisted the survey \\\"most vigorously.\\\"[16] The Panic of 1873 forced the Northern Pacific Railway's backers (such as Jay Cooke) into bankruptcy. This halted construction of the railroad through Sioux territory. After the discovery and new wealth from gold in California, other men became interested in the potential for gold mining in the Black Hills. In 1874, Lt. Col. George Armstrong Custer led a military expedition from Fort Abraham Lincoln near Bismarck, to explore the Black Hills for gold and to determine a suitable location for a military fort in the Hills.[17] Custer's announcement of gold in the Black Hills triggered the Black Hills Gold Rush. Tensions increased between the Sioux and European Americans' seeking to move into the Black Hills.[18] Although Sitting Bull did not attack Custer's expedition in 1874, the US government was increasingly pressured to open the Black Hills to mining and settlement. It was alarmed at reports of Sioux depredations (encouraged by Sitting Bull). In November 1875, the government ordered all Sioux bands outside the Great Sioux Reservation to move onto the reservation, knowing full well that not all would comply. As of February 1, 1876, the Interior Department certified as \\\"hostile\\\" those bands who continued to live off the reservation.[19] This certification allowed the military to pursue Sitting Bull and other Lakota bands as \\\"hostiles\\\". According to the historian Margot Liberty, many Lakota bands allied with the Cheyenne during the Plains Wars because they thought the other nation was under attack by the US. Given this connection, she suggests the major war should have been called \\\"The Great Cheyenne War\\\". Since 1860, the Northern Cheyenne had led several battles among the Plains Indians. Before 1876, the US Army had destroyed seven Cheyenne camps, more than those of any other nation.[20] However, other historians such as Robert M. Utley[21] and Jerome Greene[22][23] also use Lakota oral testimony as the basis for their conclusions that the Lakota coalition, of which Sitting Bull was the ostensible head, was the primary target of the federal government's pacification campaign. Battle of the Little Bighorn[edit] For more details on this topic, see Battle of the Little Bighorn.     Little Bighorn battlefield   During the period 18681876, Sitting Bull developed into the most important of Native American chiefs. After the Treaty of Fort Laramie (1868) and the creation of the Great Sioux Reservation, many traditional Sioux warriors, such as Red Cloud of the Oglala and Spotted Tail of the Brul, moved to reside permanently on the reservations. They were largely dependent for subsistence on the US Indian agencies. Many other chiefs, including members of Sitting Bull's Hunkpapa band such as Gall, at times lived temporarily at the agencies. They needed the supplies at a time when white encroachment and the depletion of buffalo herds reduced their resources and challenged Native American independence.[citation needed] In 1875, the Northern Cheyenne, Hunkpapa, Oglala, Sans Arc, and Minneconjou camped together for a Sun Dance, with both the Cheyenne medicine man White Bull or Ice and Sitting Bull in association. This ceremonial alliance preceded their fighting together in 1876.[20] Sitting Bull had a major revelation.  At the climactic moment, \\\"Sitting Bull intoned, 'The Great Spirit has given our enemies to us. We are to destroy them. We do not know who they are. They may be soldiers.' Ice too observed, 'No one then knew who the enemy were  of what tribe.'...They were soon to find out.\\\"(Utley 1992: 12224)  Sitting Bull's refusal to adopt any dependence on the white man meant that at times he and his small band of warriors lived isolated on the Plains. When Native Americans were threatened by the United States, numerous members from various Sioux bands and other tribes, such as the North Cheyenne, came to Sitting Bull's camp. His reputation for \\\"strong medicine\\\" developed as he continued to evade the European Americans.     Sketch of Sitting Bull; Harper's Weekly, December 8, 1877 issue.   After the January 1st ultimatum of 1876, when the US Army began to track down Sioux and others living off the reservation as hostiles, Native Americans gathered at Sitting Bull's camp. The chief took an active role in encouraging this \\\"unity camp\\\". He sent scouts to the reservations to recruit warriors, and told the Hunkpapa to share supplies with those Native Americans who joined them. An example of his generosity was Sitting Bull's taking care of Wooden Leg's Northern Cheyenne tribe. They had been impoverished by Captain Reynold's March 17, 1876 attack and fled to Sitting Bull's camp for safety.[20] The Hunkpapa chief provided resources to sustain the new recruits. Over the course of the first half of 1876, Sitting Bull's camp continually expanded, as natives joined him for safety in numbers. His leadership had attracted the warriors and families of an extensive village, estimated at more than 10,000 people. Lt. Col. Custer came across this large camp on June 25, 1876. Sitting Bull did not take a direct military role in the ensuing battle; instead he acted as a spiritual chief and had performed the Sun Dance, in which he fasted and sacrificed over 100 pieces of flesh from his arms, a week prior to the attack.[4] Custers 7th Cavalry advance party attacked Cheyenne and Lakota tribes at their camp on the Little Big Horn River (known as the Greasy Grass River to the Lakota) on June 25, 1876. The U.S. Army did not realize how large the camp was. More than 2,000 Native American warriors had left their reservations to follow Sitting Bull. Inspired by a vision of Sitting Bulls, in which he saw U.S. soldiers being killed as they entered the tribes camp, the Cheyenne and Lakota fought back. Custer's badly outnumbered troops lost ground quickly and were forced to retreat. The tribes led a counter-attack against the soldiers on a nearby ridge, ultimately annihilating them.[24] The Native Americans' victory celebrations were short-lived. Public shock and outrage at Custer's death and defeat, and the government's knowledge about the remaining Sioux, led them to assign thousands more soldiers to the area. Over the next year, the new American military forces pursued the Lakota, forcing many of the Native Americans to surrender. Sitting Bull refused to surrender and in May 1877 led his band across the border into Saskatchewan, Canada. He remained in exile for four years near Wood Mountain, refusing a pardon and the chance to return.[25] When crossing the border into Saskatchewan, Sitting Bull was met by the Canadian Mounties of the region. During this meeting, James Morrow Walsh, commander of the North-West Mounted Police, explained to Sitting Bull that the Lakota were now on British soil and must obey British law. Walsh emphasized that he enforced the law equally and that every person in the territory had a right to justice. Walsh became an advocate for Sitting Bull and the two became good friends for the remainder of their lives.[26] Also while in Canada Sitting Bull met with chief Crowfoot, who was a chief of the Blackfeet, long-time powerful enemies of the Lakota and Cheyenne. Sitting Bull wished to make peace with the Blackfeet Nation and Crowfoot. Being an advocate for peace himself, Crowfoot eagerly accepted the tobacco peace offering. Sitting Bull was so impressed by the Blackfeet chief that he named one of his sons after him.[27] Sitting Bull and his men only stayed in Canada for 4 years. Due to the smaller size of the buffalo herds in Canada, Sitting Bull and his men found it difficult to find enough food to feed his people, who were starving and exhausted. Furthermore, due to Sitting Bulls presence in the country, there had been a growth in tension between the Canadian and the United States governments.[28] Before Sitting Bull left Saskatchewan, he may have visited Walsh for a final time and left a ceremonial headdress as a memento.[29] Surrender[edit]     Fort Buford's original 1872 Commanding Officer's Quarters where Sitting Bull's surrender ceremony was held   Hunger and desperation eventually forced Sitting Bull, and 186 of his family and followers to return to the United States and surrender on July 19, 1881. Sitting Bull had his young son Crow Foot surrender his Winchester lever-action carbine to Major David H. Brotherton, commanding officer of Fort Buford in the parlor of the Commanding Officer's Quarters in a ceremony the next day. He told the 4 soldiers, 20 warriors and other guests in the small room, that he wished to regard the soldiers and the white race as friends but he wanted to know who would teach his son the new ways of the world. Two weeks later, after waiting in vain for other members of his tribe to follow him from Canada, the Army transferred Sitting Bull and his band to Fort Yates, the military post located adjacent to the Standing Rock Agency, which straddles the present-day boundary of North and South Dakota.[citation needed] Sitting Bull and his band of 186 people were kept separate from the other Hunkpapa gathered at the agency. Army officials were concerned that the famed chief would stir up trouble among the recently surrendered northern bands. On August 26, 1881, he was visited by the census taker William T. Selwyn, who counted twelve people in the Hunkpapa leader's immediate family. Forty-one families, totaling 195 people, were recorded in Sitting Bull's band.[30] The military decided to transfer him and his band to Fort Randall, to be held as prisoners of war. Loaded onto a steamboat, the band of 172 people was sent down the Missouri River to Fort Randall (near present-day Pickstown, South Dakota on the southern border of the state). There they spent the next 20 months. They were allowed to return north to the Standing Rock Agency in May 1883.[citation needed] Wild West Show participation[edit] In 1885, Sitting Bull was allowed to leave the reservation to go Wild Westing with Buffalo Bill Codys Buffalo Bill's Wild West. He got about $50 a week for riding once around the arena, where he was a popular attraction. Although it is rumored that he cursed his audiences in his native tongue during the show, the historian Utley contends that he did not.[31] Historians have reported that Sitting Bull gave speeches about his desire for education for the young, and reconciling relations between the Sioux and whites.[32] The historian Edward Lazarus wrote that Sitting Bull reportedly cursed his audience in Lakota in 1884, during an opening address celebrating the completion of the Northern Pacific Railway.[33] During his participation with the Wild West show, Sitting Bull met Annie Oakley. He was so impressed with Oakley's skills with firearms that he offered $65 for a photographer to take a photo of the two together.[34] The admiration and respect of was mutual. Oakley stated that Sitting Bull made a \\\"great pet\\\" of her.[35] Over time, Sitting Bull's respect for the young sharpshooter grew. Oakley was quite modest in her attire, deeply respectful of others and had a remarkable stage persona despite being a woman who stood only five feet in height. Sitting Bull felt that she was \\\"gifted\\\" by supernatural means in order to shoot so accurately with both hands. As a result of his esteem, he adopted her as a daughter in 1884. He named her \\\"Little Sure Shot\\\" -- a name that Oakley used throughout her career.[36] Sitting Bull stayed with the show for four months before returning home. During that time, audiences began to consider him a celebrity and a romanticized warrior. He earned a small fortune by charging for his autograph and picture, although he often gave his money away to the homeless and beggars.[37] Conversion[edit] In 1883, rumors floated that Sitting Bull had been baptized into the Catholic Church. James McLaughlin, Indian agent at Standing Rock Agency, dismissed these reports, saying that \\\"The reported baptism of Sitting-Bull is erroneous. There is no immediate prospect of such ceremony so far as I am aware.\\\" [38][39][40] Death and burial[edit]     \\\"Wild scene\\\", \\\"Squaws death chant heard in every direction\\\"       Monument at Sitting Bull's grave, Mobridge, South Dakota, 2003   Sitting Bull returned to the Standing Rock Agency after working in Buffalo Bill's Wild West Show. In 1890, James McLaughlin, the U.S. Indian Agent at Fort Yates on Standing Rock Agency, feared that the Lakota leader was about to flee the reservation with the Ghost Dancers, so he ordered the police to arrest him.[41] On December 14, 1890, McLaughlin drafted a letter to Lt. Henry Bullhead that included instructions and a plan to capture the chief. The plan called for the arrest to take place at dawn on December 15, and advised the use of a light spring wagon to facilitate the chief's removal before his followers could rally. Bullhead decided against using the wagon. He intended to have the police officers force Sitting Bull to mount a horse immediately after the arrest.[42] Around 5:30 a.m. on December 15, 39 police officers and four volunteers approached Sitting Bull's house. They surrounded the house, knocked and entered. Bullhead told Sitting Bull that he was under arrest and led him outside.[43] The camp awakened and men converged at the house of their chief. As Bullhead ordered Sitting Bull to mount a horse, he explained that the Indian Affairs agent needed to see him and then he could return to his house. Sitting Bull refused to comply and the police used force on him. The Sioux in the village were enraged. A Sioux known as Catch-the-Bear shouldered his rifle and shot Bullhead who, in return, fired his revolver into the chest of Sitting Bull.[44] Another police officer, Red Tomahawk, shot Sitting Bull in the head, and the chief dropped to the ground. He died between 12 and 1 p.m.[citation needed] A close-quarters fight erupted, and within minutes several men were dead. Six policemen were killed immediately and two more died shortly after the fight. Sitting Bull and seven of his supporters lay dead, along with two horses.[45] Sitting Bull's body was taken to Fort Yates to be placed in a coffin (made by the Army carpenter)[46] and for burial. In 1953 Lakota family members exhumed what they believed to be his remains, to be reinterred near Mobridge, South Dakota, his birthplace.[47][48] Legacy[edit]     Sitting Bull, 1882   Following Sitting Bull's death, his cabin on the Grand River was taken to Chicago to become an exhibit at the 1893 World's Columbian Exposition. Native American dancers also performed at the Exposition.[49] Sitting Bull was the subject of, or a featured character in, several Hollywood motion pictures and documentaries. Among them are:  Sitting Bull: The Hostile Sioux Indian Chief (1914) Sitting Bull at the Spirit Lake Massacre (1927) Annie Get Your Gun (1950) Sitting Bull (1954) Buffalo Bill and the Indians, or Sitting Bull's History Lesson (1976) Into the West (2005) Bury My Heart at Wounded Knee (2007) Sitting Bull: A Stone in My Heart (2008) Documentary [50]  As time passed, Sitting Bull became a symbol and archetype of Native American resistance movements as well as a figure celebrated by his former enemies:  On September 14, 1989, the United States Postal Service released a Great Americans series 28 postage stamp featuring a likeness of Sitting Bull.[51] On March 6, 1996, Standing Rock College was renamed Sitting Bull College in his honor. Sitting Bull College serves as an institution of higher education on Sitting Bull's home of Standing Rock in North Dakota and South Dakota. The American historian Gary Clayton Anderson of the University of Oklahoma published Sitting Bull and the Paradox of Lakota Nationhood a revisionist examination of the Lakota medicine man. Anderson stresses the Little Big Horn not so much as a mishap by Custer but in light of past succeses the Lakota Nation and the merits of Sitting Bull himself.[52] Legoland Billund, the first Legoland park, contains a Lego sculpture of Sitting Bull, the largest sculpture in the park. Sitting Bull is featured as the leader for the Native American Civilization in the computer game Civilization IV.[53] Sitting Bull is lionized as one of 13 great Americans in President Barack Obama's children's book, Of Thee I Sing: A Letter to My Daughters.[54] In August 2010, a research team led by Eske Willerslev, an ancient DNA expert at the University of Copenhagen, announced their intention to sequence the genome of Sitting Bull, with the approval of his descendents using a hair sample obtained during his lifetime.[55]  Gallery[edit]        Sitting Bull's grave at Fort Yates, ca. 1906          Sitting Bull and Buffalo Bill in 1885          Sitting Bull in Pierre, South Dakota on his way to Standing Rock Agency from Fort Randall          Sitting Bull (Tatonka-I-Yatanka), a Hunkpapa Sioux, 1885     See also[edit]  Black Elk Henry Mabb Catherine Weldon  Footnotes[edit]   ^ Encyclopdia Britannica 20. 1955. p.723. ^ New Lakota Dictionary, 2008 ^ Kehoe, Alice (2006).

Parks:  Tokyo Disneyland Tokyo DisneySea Tokyo Disney Forest  Shopping, dining and entertainment complex:  Ikspiari  Resort hotels:  Disney's Ambassador Hotel Tokyo DisneySea Hotel MiraCosta Tokyo Disneyland Hotel  Disneyland Paris[edit] Main article: Disneyland Paris Disneyland Paris, Disney's second resort complex outside the United States, opened on April 12, 1992, as the Euro Disney Resort. Located in Marne-la-Valle in the suburbs of Paris, France, it features two theme parks, a golf course, an entertainment complex and six Disney resort hotels. It is maintained and managed by Euro Disney S.C.A., a company partially owned by The Walt Disney Company whose stock is traded on Euronext. Its properties sit on 4,940 acres (20.0km2), listed below, and are divided into parks, shopping centers, and lodging: Parks:  Disneyland Park Walt Disney Studios Park  Other parks:  Golf Disneyland  Shopping, dining and entertainment complex:  Disney Village  Resort hotels:  Disneyland Paris Hotel Disney's Hotel New York Disney's Newport Bay Club Disney's Sequoia Lodge Disney's Hotel Cheyenne Disney's Hotel Santa Fe Disney's Davy Crockett Ranch  Hong Kong Disneyland Resort[edit] Main article: Hong Kong Disneyland Resort Hong Kong Disneyland Resort, Disney's fifth resort and its second in Asia, opened September 12, 2005. The resort is located in Penny's Bay, Lantau Island, Hong Kong. The resort consists of one theme park and two hotels, with land reserved for future expansion. It is owned and operated by Hong Kong International Theme Parks, an incorporated company jointly owned by The Walt Disney Company and the Government of Hong Kong. The first phase of Hong Kong Disneyland Resort occupies 320 acres (1.3km2). Park:  Hong Kong Disneyland  Other park:  Inspiration Lake Recreation Centre  Resort hotels:  Hong Kong Disneyland Hotel Disney's Hollywood Hotel  Shanghai Disney Resort[edit] Main article: Shanghai Disney Resort In November 2009, Disney received approval from the central government of China to build a Disney theme park in Shanghai's Pudong district. \\\"China is one of the most dynamic, exciting and important countries in the world and this approval marks a very significant milestone for Walt Disney Co in mainland China,\\\" said Robert Iger, president and CEO of Disney.[2] The resort is expected to open in 2015. A groundbreaking ceremony took place on April 7, 2011.[3] Park:  Shanghai Disneyland Park  Disney Cruise Line[edit] Main article: Disney Cruise Line Disney Cruise Line was formed in 1995. Its fleet comprises four ships: Disney Magic (launched 1998), Disney Wonder (1999), Disney Dream (2011), and Disney Fantasy (2012). Each ship was designed and built in collaboration with Walt Disney Imagineering. Disney Cruise Line offers three, four and five-night cruises in the Bahamas; seven-night Alaskan cruises; seven-night Mexican Riviera cruises; and seven-night Caribbean cruises. The Bahamas and Caribbean itineraries include a stop at Disney's private island in the Bahamas, Castaway Cay. In 2012, Disney Cruises will depart from Port Canaveral, Los Angeles, Seattle, Galveston and New York. Fleet:  Disney Magic Disney Wonder Disney Dream Disney Fantasy  Properties:  Castaway Cay  Disney Regional Entertainment[edit] Disney Regional Entertainment was the division of Walt Disney Parks and Resorts which developed and operated unique concepts. It previously operated the Club Disney, DisneyQuest and ESPN Zone concepts. The only remaining DisneyQuest in Downtown Disney at the Walt Disney World Resort is now operated directly by the resort. The only two remaining ESPN Zone restaurants in Los Angeles and Downtown Disney at the Disneyland Resort are operated by third parties. Projects:  ESPN Zone, a chain of sports-themed restaurants. Club Disney, a now-closed chain of children's entertainment centers. DisneyQuest, an indoor arcade with traditional and virtual reality experiences.  Other ventures[edit]  Three World of Disney retail stores managed by the Parks and Resorts merchandise division. Disney Vacation Club, a timeshare program that includes several themed resorts within Disneyland Resort, Walt Disney World Resort, Hong Kong Disneyland Resort plus Disney's Aulani Resort, Disney's Hilton Head Island Resort and Disney's Vero Beach Resort. Adventures by Disney, a program of all-inclusive, guided vacation tour packages offered at predominantly non-Disney sites around the world.  Abandoned concepts[edit] Disney had plans to build Walt Disney's Riverfront Square in St. Louis. In July 1965, Disney cancelled the project. In the 1960s, Disney initiated a plan for a ski resort at Mineral King in California. Opposition from environmental groups led by the Sierra Club led to a temporary court injunction in 1969 and legal battles through the 1970s. The project's planning and scale changed multiple times, and in 1978 Mineral King was annexed into Sequoia National Park, ending any possibility of developing a ski resort.[4] Disney reportedly had plans to build a park named Disney's America. The park was to have been located in Haymarket, Virginia, but local opposition to the idea persuaded Disney to abandon the idea in 1994. On September 28, 1994, Michael Eisner announced that Disney was cancelling its plans to build Disney's America after a bruising national media fight with Protect Historic America and aggressive local opposition in Virginia from Protect Prince William and other citizen groups. Future projects[edit] Asian and European projects[edit] Both Hong Kong Disneyland Resort and Disneyland Paris have room for future expansion.[5] In November 2009, Disney received approval from the Chinese government to build a Disneyland resort in Shanghai's Pudong district.[6] The resort is expected to open in Fall 2015.[3] In early January 2011, conflicting reports emerged regarding Disney's involvement in a proposed entertainment complex in Haifa, Israel, whose plans include a small (30,000 square meter) amusement park scheduled to open in 2013. The project will be partially funded by Shamrock Holdings, a Disney-affiliated investment firm. In the wake of reports from Israeli business newspaper Globes and industry newswire Amusement Management that Disney itself would be involved in the project's development, a spokesperson for Walt Disney Parks and Resorts clarified to Fast Company that Disney did not have any plans to involve itself in the building of the park.[7] Hong Kong Disneyland expansion[edit] Rita Lau, the Secretary for Commerce and Economic Development for Hong Kong, announced that the expansion of Hong Kong Disneyland had been approved by the Executive Council on June 30, 2009, and also approved by the Legislative Council of Hong Kong on July 10, 2009. The park will receive three new lands: Grizzly Gulch, Mystic Point and Toy Story Land. Construction began in late 2009 and will take 5 years to complete. The park will feature a total of seven themed lands after the completion of all the new additions. American projects[edit] Disney has made no announcements regarding plans for another American theme park and CEO Robert Iger frequently has cited international expansion as one of the company's three strategic priorities.[8] In October 2007, Disney announced plans to build a resort at Ko Olina Resort & Marina in Kapolei, Hawaii, featuring both a hotel and Disney Vacation Club timeshare units. The 800-unit property, named Aulani, opened in 2011 and joins the other resorts not associated with a theme park, such as Disney's Hilton Head Island Resort in South Carolina.[9] In September 2011, Walt Disney Parks and Resorts announced plans to partner with filmmaker James Cameron and his Lightstorm Entertainment production company, along with 20th Century Fox, to develop theme park attractions based on Cameron's Avatar film franchise, with the first installation planned for Disney's Animal Kingdom at Walt Disney World, in the form of an Avatar-based section of the park. While no specific plans or attractions were announced, construction on the new area is expected to begin by 2013.[10] Disney also secured exclusive global theme parks rights to the Avatar franchise.[11] Properties outside Disney parks[edit] Due to its acquisitions of Marvel Entertainment in 2009 and Lucasfilm in 2012, some Disney-owned franchises are represented in its competitors' parks. Marvel Super Hero Island, a themed land featuring characters and settings from Marvel Comics, has operated at Universal Orlando Resort's Islands of Adventure park since 1999. A Star Wars-themed section of Legoland California's Miniland USA opened in 2011, with a similar version set to open at Legoland Florida in November of 2012, just weeks after Disney's acquisition of Lucasfilm and the Star Wars franchise.

The fair, the theme of which was \\\"Transportation and Communication: World in Motion - World in Touch\\\", coincided with Vancouver's centennial and was held on the north shore of False Creek. It was the second time that Canada held a World's Fair, the first being Expo 67 in Montreal (during the Canadian Centennial). It was also the third World's Fair to be held in the Pacific Northwest in the last 25 years as of 1986 and as of 2012 it still stands as the latest World's Fair to be held in North America.

After the site closed, it was shipped to England where it was installed at the Alton Towers theme park in 1987.   The logo of three interlocking rings to make the 86 in the logo stood for the three main modes of transportation; land, air, and water. Background[edit] Up until the late 1970s, the 173 acre (0.7km2) site on False Creek, where Expo was staged, was a former CPR rail yard and an industrial wasteland. In 1978, Sam Bawlf (then BC Minister of Recreation and Conservation) proposed an exposition to celebrate Vancouver's Centennial year (1986). The proposal was submitted in June 1979, for a fair that was to be called \\\"Transpo 86.\\\" In 1980, the British Columbia Legislature passed the Transpo 86 Corporation Act, paving the way for the fair. The transportation theme reflected the city's role in connecting Canada by rail, its status as a major port and transportation hub, and the role of transportation in communications. The initial idea was to have ...a modest $80 million transportation exposition that would mark Vancouver's 100th anniversary..[1] It soon blossomed into a full exposition thanks to the help of the Vancouver Exposition Commissioner-General at that time, Patrick Reid. The theme of Transportation and Communication led to the conglomeration of many different exhibits of transportation networks. This included a monorail that glided over the crowds that included a trip to every zone. Other ground transports included a Skytrain, a High Speed Surface Transport from Japan, and a French People Mover. (basically a little boxcar). The transports of the sky was the Gondola, a boxcar hovering high in the air. The water taxis moved along four different ports on the site.[2] The fair was awarded to Vancouver by the Bureau of International Expositions in November 1980. However, once it became clear that the event would be a world exposition, the name was officially changed to \\\"Expo 86\\\" by Ambassador and Commissioner General Patrick Reid in October 1981, and, by the end of the year, Expo 86 Corporation was established as a nonprofit agency responsible in the planning and operation of the fair. Local business tycoon Jim Pattison was appointed as CEO, and would eventually also become the president of the corporation. The chief architect selected was Bruno Freschi, the Creative Director was Ron Woodall, and Bob Smith was responsible for the production and design. Construction started in October 1983, when Elizabeth II, Queen of Canada, started a concrete mixer on the future site of the Canada Pavilion, and offered the \\\"invitation to the world.\\\"[3] But, work was disrupted by labour disputes for 5 months. Still, Expo Centre opened May 2, 1985, as a preview centre for the fair. The fair was originally budgeted for a modest CAN$78 million. However, final expenditures for the expanded event totaled $802 million with a deficit of CAN$311 million.[4] The Fair[edit] Expo '86 was opened by Charles, Prince of Wales, Diana, Princess of Wales, and Prime Minister Brian Mulroney on Friday, May 2, 1986. It featured pavilions from 54 nations and numerous corporations. Expo's participants were given the opportunity to design their own pavilion or opt for the less expensive Expo module. Each module was approximately two-and-a-half stories high and had the floor space equal to a third of a city block. The design was such that any number of the square modules could be placed together in a variety of shapes. The roof design allowed the interior exhibit space to be uninterrupted by pillars. This World's Fair was categorized as a \\\"Class II,\\\" or \\\"specialized exhibition,\\\" reflecting its specific emphases on transportation and communications.

Vanuatu, Western Samoa, and Yugoslavia. Legacy[edit] In all, 22 million people attended the expo and, despite a deficit of $311 million CAD, it was considered a tremendous success. It remains to date the second biggest event in British Columbia history and is viewed by many as the transition of Vancouver from a sleepy provincial backwater to a city with global clout.[citation needed] It marked a strong boost to tourism for the province. Many[who?] have also seen the fair as being at least partially responsible for the re-election of the Social Credit party for its final term as a provincial government. Today, the western half of the site has and is continuing to be developed into parks and high rise condominiums. The eastern portion was used for the annual Molson Indy race, until it was cancelled in late 2004. Future plans call for the eastern third of the site to be developed into parkland and condominiums. The western third of the site is presently owned by the real estate investment firm Concord Pacific, which has its primary shareholder the Hong Kong billionaire Li Ka-Shing. The redevelopment took longer than expected, but is one of the most successful urban developments in Canadian history.[citation needed] The south eastern section of the site just underneath the former Expo Center was redeveloped for use as part the Olympic Village for the 2010 Winter Olympics. After the Olympics, it will also be redeveloped into condos and park land[dated info]. Expo 86 will be remembered for the warm, friendly spirit that existed among the exhibitors, staff, 8000 volunteers and visitors. according to Kim O'Leary[10] It put Vancouver on the map by making it into a major tourist attraction. Many of the buildings that stood in the fair stayed there, including restaurants, clubs, and the important service buildings. State of Expo 86 attractions[edit]     The former Expo 86 monorail, Swiss built Von Roll Seilbahnen AG Mark II, is now installed at Alton Towers in the United Kingdom.   Some of the lasting contributions of Expo 86 to the city of Vancouver include:  SkyTrain - A fully automated elevated advanced rapid transit system. The first line was built intending partially to serve Expo, with construction beginning in the autumn of 1982 and revenue service opening in December 1985. SkyTrain has since become the backbone of the city's metropolitan transit system (metro) and the system has been extended five times, including three minor expansions to the original revenue line Expo Line in 1989, 1990, and 1994 as well as the construction of two additional metro lines Millennium Line and Canada Line in 2001 and 2009, respectfully. Construction of a fourth metro line, the Evergreen Line, to Coquitlam as well as guideway, station, and train retrofitting of the entire Expo Line are underway as of 2012. Today, SkyTrain transports over 350,000 passengers daily. SkyTrain still uses its original 1985-86 Expo fleet of trains (Bombardier/UTDC Mark I) as part of daily revenue service as well as new, modern ones that have additional capacity and more advanced technology (Mark II, Mark III). Expo Centre - Science World - An interactive educational centre with an OMNIMAX cinema. It opened May 2, 1986, as the Expo Centre. Between 1989 and 1990, after much public support, the building was expanded, and in late 1990, it opened to the general public as a science museum, \\\"Science World\\\". In 2005 the name was changed to Science World at Telus World of Science. BC Place Stadium - All-purpose domed sports stadium (primarily for the Vancouver Whitecaps FC & BC Lions), home of the opening of Expo '86. The stadium was also home of the 2010 Winter Olympic Games, Opening and Closing Ceremonies. BC Place opened June 19, 1983. SkyTrain's Stadium-Chinatown Station (then, \\\"Stadium Station\\\") was built for this landmark in 1985, and has since served all major sporting and concert events since 1986. In May 2010, the landmark teflon roof was deflated, and is was replaced with a new retractable roof as well as over all structural upgrades and a complete interior design makeover. BC Place reopened on September 30, 2011 as the world's largest cable supported retractable roof stadium. Canada Place The Canada Government pavilion is now a major downtown convention centre and cruise ship docks. It has seen major use over the years and was expanded to allow for bigger cruise ships to dock in 1999. In 2009, a companion building immediately to the northwest was completed. SkyTrain's terminus Waterfront Station served Canada Place in 1986. A special shuttle train between Waterfront and Stadium Station was used throughout the duration of the fair to get patrons between the Canada Pavilion and main Expo site along False Creek. Plaza of Nations - This space has been used as an outdoor concert venue and public plaza with the surrounding buildings used as office space and nightclubs. Since Expo ended, the glass canopy that was connected to the adjacent office buildings was found unsafe and torn down, while in 2007 it was decided that the office buildings will be demolished. The B.C. Pavilion structure remains, and is now the site of the Edgewater Casino. Once the offices are demolished it will leave Canada Place, the B.C. Pavilion and the Telus World of Science as the only remaining structures from Expo directly left on the Expo site.  After the fair closed many of the attractions were auctioned off to buyers. The dispersed Expo '86 building include:     The McBarge is currently anchored derelict in Burrard Inlet next to an oil refinery       The Pub left is formerly the China Gate Restaurant. The Lighthouse right was formerly a spaceship atop a McDonalds. It is now the Lighthouse Pub in Sechelt BC    Monorail - now located at Alton Towers Theme Park in England McBarge (officially Friendship 500) - a floating McDonald's now essentially abandoned in the waters of Burrard Inlet, Burnaby (locally known as \\\"McDerelict\\\"). It can be seen when riding the West Coast Express. Space Ship McDonalds The Spaceship motif from the restaurant was dismantled and the wings were removed. The remodelled pieces were then shipped to Sechelt and reconstructed as a lighthouse to go atop the Lighthouse Pub. China Gate - donated by the Chinese Government to the City of Vancouver. The landmark was relocated in 1987 to Pender Street in Vancouver's Chinatown. China Gate Cafe was dismantled and moved to Sechelt BC and is now the home to the Lighthouse Pub. World's largest ice hockey stick - now in Duncan, British Columbia at the local hockey rink World's largest Flag Pole - now in Surrey, British Columbia at Flag Motors,[citation needed] Scream Machine roller coaster - now Ninja at Six Flags St. Louis Spirit Catcher sculpture - now installed along the waterfront of Barrie, Ontario Inukshuk - once used at the Northwest Territories Pavilion, it is now used as a landmark on English Bay beach, having been relocated in 1988. It was an inspiration for the official logo for the 2010 Winter Olympics. Site Furniture - all sorts of brightly painted remnants were relocated to the PNE on East Hastings Street, as well as other parks and public areas in Greater Vancouver. Folklife Pavilion - most of the Folklife Pavilion buildings were dismantled into pieces, shipped by barge and reconstructed as the Folklife Village, the main shopping center on Gabriola Island, BC UFO H2O - the water park is now at Mount Layton Hot Springs Resort in Terrace, British Columbia. Dragonboats - the 6 teak wooden boats used to celebrate Hong Kong (pavilion) Day by holding a Dragon Boat racing festival can still be seen today on False Creek and are still raced annually. Expo building modules - Numerous former pavilion structures were disassembled and reconstructed, largely for industrial use throughout the Lower Mainland, and few has survived to 2013. They can be identified by their distinctive peaked corners with exposed tubular girders. They can be found in an Industrial Parks of Delta, British Columbia. Russian Pavilion - The Russian Pavilion had a special roof designed with triangles which allowed for maximum floor space coverage without any beams coming down to support it save for the outside of the building. It was dismantled and relocated now housing machinery at the Kruger_Products paper plant in New Westminster British Columbia. Bench Seating - iconic painted wire grid bench seating, coloured as the different zone colours of the fair, with formed concrete bases and the \\\"86\\\" logo branded into the sides, can be seen at various locales around the Greater Vancouver area, notably along the White Rock beach promenade.  Reunions[edit] A group of former Expo '86 employees conducted a 20th anniversary reunion for Expo participants on May 2, 2006, at the Plaza of Nations site. A group of former BC Pavilion employees celebrated the 20th anniversary of the close of Expo 86 at a reunion [1] on October 13, 2006, at the former Expo Centre (now renamed the Telus World of Science). Scandal[edit] In 1988, the site was sold to the Concord Pacific development corporation for a fraction of the original cost, a move that proved to be extremely controversial. Premier William Vander Zalm and Peter Toigo were accused of influence peddling in the sale.[citation needed] Accidents[edit] While opening the World's Fair, Diana, Princess of Wales briefly fainted onto her husband in a crowded hall in the California Pavilion. She recovered quickly in the washroom, and left half an hour later. Prince Charles later said that her fainting spell was a result of heat and exhaustion. However, the Princess confessed several years later that it was actually caused by not having kept down any food for several days a result of her eating disorder. She was chastised by her husband for not \\\"fainting gracefully behind a door.\\\" On May 9, 1986, 9-year-old Karen Ford of Nanaimo, BC died at the Canadian Pavilion. She was crushed while on a revolving turntable that connected two semi-circular theatres in the pavilion. The revolving table was shut down for some time after the accident, but was put back in service with a number of new safety measures.[11] A ride operator on the looping starship ride was hit by the ride when he crossed in front of it late in the evening at the end of his shift, Most of the bones in his body were broken. It was a on a very busy weekend in September. (a source is needed) In popular media[edit]  The Vancouver-based indie band Said the Whale recorded a song called \\\"False Creek Change\\\" about the changes that Expo 86 brought to the area. The song starts: False Creek changed in '86 / The year Expo exploited her shore / It's been 22 years laying down bricks / There's no room for me here any more.   Death Cab for Cutie, from nearby Bellingham, Washington, also has a song entitled \\\"Expo '86\\\" on their album Transatlanticism.   Scenes from Vancouver (some of the Expo) have appeared in a video edition of the song \\\"If I Had Wings\\\", composed in 1986 by children's singer/songwriter Hap Palmer.   The band Wolf Parade also released an LP entitled Expo 86 in 2010.

He was killed by Indian agency police on the Standing Rock Indian Reservation during an attempt to arrest him at a time when authorities feared that he would join the Ghost Dance movement.[3] Before the Battle of the Little Bighorn, Sitting Bull had a vision in which he saw the defeat of the 7th Cavalry under Lt. Col. George Armstrong Custer on June 25, 1876. Sitting Bull's leadership motivated his people to a major victory. Months after their victory at the battle, Sitting Bull and his group left the United States for Wood Mountain, Saskatchewan, where he remained until 1881, at which time he surrendered to U.S. forces. A small remnant of his band under Chief Wabl  decided to stay at Wood Mountain. After working as a performer, Sitting Bull returned to the Standing Rock Agency in South Dakota. Because of fears that he would use his influence to support the Ghost Dance movement, Indian Service agent James McLaughlin at Fort Yates ordered his arrest. During an ensuing struggle between Sitting Bull's followers and the agency police, Sitting Bull was shot in the side and head by Standing Rock policemen Lieutenant Bull Head (Tatankapah) and Red Tomahawk (Marcelus Chankpidutah) after the police were fired upon by Sitting Bull's supporters. His body was taken to nearby Fort Yates for burial, but in 1953, his remains were possibly exhumed and reburied near Mobridge, South Dakota, by his Lakota family, who wanted his body to be nearer to his birthplace.

Despite being embroiled in the American Civil War, the United States Army retaliated in 1863 and 1864, even against bands which had not been involved in the hostilities.[8] In 1864, two brigades of about 2200 soldiers under Brigadier General Alfred Sully attacked a village. The defenders were led by Sitting Bull, Gall and Inkpaduta.[8] The Sioux were driven out, but skirmishing continued into August.[citation needed] In September, Sitting Bull and about 100 Hunkpapa Sioux came across a small party near what is now Marmarth, North Dakota. They had been left behind by a wagon train commanded by Captain James L. Fisk to effect some repairs to an overturned wagon. When he led an attack, Sitting Bull was shot in the left hip by a soldier.[8] The bullet exited out through the small of his back, and the wound was not too serious.[9] Red Cloud's War[edit] Sitting Bull led numerous war parties against Fort Berthold, Fort Stevenson, and Fort Buford and their environs from 1865 through 1868.[10] Although Red Cloud was a leader of the Oglala Sioux, his leadership and attacks against forts in the Powder River Country of Montana were supported by Sitting Bull's guerrilla attacks on emigrant parties and smaller forts throughout the upper Missouri River region.[citation needed] By early 1868, the U.S. government desired a peaceful settlement to Red Cloud's War. It agreed to Red Cloud's demands that Forts Phil Kearny and C.F. Smith be abandoned. Chief Gall of the Hunkpapas (among other representatives of the Hunkpapas, Blackfeet, and Yankton Sioux) signed a form of the Treaty of Fort Laramie on July 2, 1868 at Fort Rice (near Bismarck, North Dakota).[11] Sitting Bull did not agree to the treaty. He continued his hit-and-run attacks on forts in the upper Missouri area throughout the late 1860s and early 1870s.[12] The events of 1868 mark a historically debated period of Sitting Bull's life. According to historian Stanley Vestal, who conducted interviews with surviving Hunkpapa in 1930, Sitting Bull was made \\\"Supreme Chief of the whole Sioux Nation\\\" at this time. Later historians and ethnologists have refuted this concept of authority, as the Lakota society was highly decentralised. Lakota bands and their elders made individual decisions.[13] The Great Sioux War of 1876[edit] For more details on this topic, see Great Sioux War of 1876.     Early Cabinet card of Sitting Bull, 1881.   Sitting Bull's band of Hunkpapa continued to attack migrating parties and forts in the late 1860s. When in 1871 the Northern Pacific Railway conducted a survey for a route across the northern plains directly through Hunkpapa lands, it encountered stiff Sioux resistance.[14] The same railway people returned the following year accompanied by federal troops. Sitting Bull and the Hunkpapa attacked the survey party, which was forced to turn back.[15] In 1873, the military accompaniment for the surveyors was increased again, but Sitting Bull's forces resisted the survey \\\"most vigorously.\\\"[16] The Panic of 1873 forced the Northern Pacific Railway's backers (such as Jay Cooke) into bankruptcy. This halted construction of the railroad through Sioux territory. After the discovery and new wealth from gold in California, other men became interested in the potential for gold mining in the Black Hills. In 1874, Lt. Col. George Armstrong Custer led a military expedition from Fort Abraham Lincoln near Bismarck, to explore the Black Hills for gold and to determine a suitable location for a military fort in the Hills.[17] Custer's announcement of gold in the Black Hills triggered the Black Hills Gold Rush. Tensions increased between the Sioux and European Americans' seeking to move into the Black Hills.[18] Although Sitting Bull did not attack Custer's expedition in 1874, the US government was increasingly pressured to open the Black Hills to mining and settlement. It was alarmed at reports of Sioux depredations (encouraged by Sitting Bull). In November 1875, the government ordered all Sioux bands outside the Great Sioux Reservation to move onto the reservation, knowing full well that not all would comply. As of February 1, 1876, the Interior Department certified as \\\"hostile\\\" those bands who continued to live off the reservation.[19] This certification allowed the military to pursue Sitting Bull and other Lakota bands as \\\"hostiles\\\". According to the historian Margot Liberty, many Lakota bands allied with the Cheyenne during the Plains Wars because they thought the other nation was under attack by the US. Given this connection, she suggests the major war should have been called \\\"The Great Cheyenne War\\\". Since 1860, the Northern Cheyenne had led several battles among the Plains Indians. Before 1876, the US Army had destroyed seven Cheyenne camps, more than those of any other nation.[20] However, other historians such as Robert M. Utley[21] and Jerome Greene[22][23] also use Lakota oral testimony as the basis for their conclusions that the Lakota coalition, of which Sitting Bull was the ostensible head, was the primary target of the federal government's pacification campaign. Battle of the Little Bighorn[edit] For more details on this topic, see Battle of the Little Bighorn.     Little Bighorn battlefield   During the period 18681876, Sitting Bull developed into the most important of Native American chiefs. After the Treaty of Fort Laramie (1868) and the creation of the Great Sioux Reservation, many traditional Sioux warriors, such as Red Cloud of the Oglala and Spotted Tail of the Brul, moved to reside permanently on the reservations. They were largely dependent for subsistence on the US Indian agencies. Many other chiefs, including members of Sitting Bull's Hunkpapa band such as Gall, at times lived temporarily at the agencies. They needed the supplies at a time when white encroachment and the depletion of buffalo herds reduced their resources and challenged Native American independence.[citation needed] In 1875, the Northern Cheyenne, Hunkpapa, Oglala, Sans Arc, and Minneconjou camped together for a Sun Dance, with both the Cheyenne medicine man White Bull or Ice and Sitting Bull in association. This ceremonial alliance preceded their fighting together in 1876.[20] Sitting Bull had a major revelation.  At the climactic moment, \\\"Sitting Bull intoned, 'The Great Spirit has given our enemies to us. We are to destroy them. We do not know who they are. They may be soldiers.' Ice too observed, 'No one then knew who the enemy were  of what tribe.'...They were soon to find out.\\\"(Utley 1992: 12224)  Sitting Bull's refusal to adopt any dependence on the white man meant that at times he and his small band of warriors lived isolated on the Plains. When Native Americans were threatened by the United States, numerous members from various Sioux bands and other tribes, such as the North Cheyenne, came to Sitting Bull's camp. His reputation for \\\"strong medicine\\\" developed as he continued to evade the European Americans.     Sketch of Sitting Bull; Harper's Weekly, December 8, 1877 issue.   After the January 1st ultimatum of 1876, when the US Army began to track down Sioux and others living off the reservation as hostiles, Native Americans gathered at Sitting Bull's camp. The chief took an active role in encouraging this \\\"unity camp\\\". He sent scouts to the reservations to recruit warriors, and told the Hunkpapa to share supplies with those Native Americans who joined them. An example of his generosity was Sitting Bull's taking care of Wooden Leg's Northern Cheyenne tribe. They had been impoverished by Captain Reynold's March 17, 1876 attack and fled to Sitting Bull's camp for safety.[20] The Hunkpapa chief provided resources to sustain the new recruits. Over the course of the first half of 1876, Sitting Bull's camp continually expanded, as natives joined him for safety in numbers. His leadership had attracted the warriors and families of an extensive village, estimated at more than 10,000 people. Lt. Col. Custer came across this large camp on June 25, 1876. Sitting Bull did not take a direct military role in the ensuing battle; instead he acted as a spiritual chief and had performed the Sun Dance, in which he fasted and sacrificed over 100 pieces of flesh from his arms, a week prior to the attack.[4] Custers 7th Cavalry advance party attacked Cheyenne and Lakota tribes at their camp on the Little Big Horn River (known as the Greasy Grass River to the Lakota) on June 25, 1876. The U.S. Army did not realize how large the camp was. More than 2,000 Native American warriors had left their reservations to follow Sitting Bull. Inspired by a vision of Sitting Bulls, in which he saw U.S. soldiers being killed as they entered the tribes camp, the Cheyenne and Lakota fought back. Custer's badly outnumbered troops lost ground quickly and were forced to retreat. The tribes led a counter-attack against the soldiers on a nearby ridge, ultimately annihilating them.[24] The Native Americans' victory celebrations were short-lived. Public shock and outrage at Custer's death and defeat, and the government's knowledge about the remaining Sioux, led them to assign thousands more soldiers to the area. Over the next year, the new American military forces pursued the Lakota, forcing many of the Native Americans to surrender. Sitting Bull refused to surrender and in May 1877 led his band across the border into Saskatchewan, Canada. He remained in exile for four years near Wood Mountain, refusing a pardon and the chance to return.[25] When crossing the border into Saskatchewan, Sitting Bull was met by the Canadian Mounties of the region. During this meeting, James Morrow Walsh, commander of the North-West Mounted Police, explained to Sitting Bull that the Lakota were now on British soil and must obey British law. Walsh emphasized that he enforced the law equally and that every person in the territory had a right to justice. Walsh became an advocate for Sitting Bull and the two became good friends for the remainder of their lives.[26] Also while in Canada Sitting Bull met with chief Crowfoot, who was a chief of the Blackfeet, long-time powerful enemies of the Lakota and Cheyenne. Sitting Bull wished to make peace with the Blackfeet Nation and Crowfoot. Being an advocate for peace himself, Crowfoot eagerly accepted the tobacco peace offering. Sitting Bull was so impressed by the Blackfeet chief that he named one of his sons after him.[27] Sitting Bull and his men only stayed in Canada for 4 years. Due to the smaller size of the buffalo herds in Canada, Sitting Bull and his men found it difficult to find enough food to feed his people, who were starving and exhausted. Furthermore, due to Sitting Bulls presence in the country, there had been a growth in tension between the Canadian and the United States governments.[28] Before Sitting Bull left Saskatchewan, he may have visited Walsh for a final time and left a ceremonial headdress as a memento.[29] Surrender[edit]     Fort Buford's original 1872 Commanding Officer's Quarters where Sitting Bull's surrender ceremony was held   Hunger and desperation eventually forced Sitting Bull, and 186 of his family and followers to return to the United States and surrender on July 19, 1881. Sitting Bull had his young son Crow Foot surrender his Winchester lever-action carbine to Major David H. Brotherton, commanding officer of Fort Buford in the parlor of the Commanding Officer's Quarters in a ceremony the next day. He told the 4 soldiers, 20 warriors and other guests in the small room, that he wished to regard the soldiers and the white race as friends but he wanted to know who would teach his son the new ways of the world. Two weeks later, after waiting in vain for other members of his tribe to follow him from Canada, the Army transferred Sitting Bull and his band to Fort Yates, the military post located adjacent to the Standing Rock Agency, which straddles the present-day boundary of North and South Dakota.[citation needed] Sitting Bull and his band of 186 people were kept separate from the other Hunkpapa gathered at the agency. Army officials were concerned that the famed chief would stir up trouble among the recently surrendered northern bands. On August 26, 1881, he was visited by the census taker William T. Selwyn, who counted twelve people in the Hunkpapa leader's immediate family. Forty-one families, totaling 195 people, were recorded in Sitting Bull's band.[30] The military decided to transfer him and his band to Fort Randall, to be held as prisoners of war. Loaded onto a steamboat, the band of 172 people was sent down the Missouri River to Fort Randall (near present-day Pickstown, South Dakota on the southern border of the state). There they spent the next 20 months. They were allowed to return north to the Standing Rock Agency in May 1883.[citation needed] Wild West Show participation[edit] In 1885, Sitting Bull was allowed to leave the reservation to go Wild Westing with Buffalo Bill Codys Buffalo Bill's Wild West. He got about $50 a week for riding once around the arena, where he was a popular attraction. Although it is rumored that he cursed his audiences in his native tongue during the show, the historian Utley contends that he did not.[31] Historians have reported that Sitting Bull gave speeches about his desire for education for the young, and reconciling relations between the Sioux and whites.[32] The historian Edward Lazarus wrote that Sitting Bull reportedly cursed his audience in Lakota in 1884, during an opening address celebrating the completion of the Northern Pacific Railway.[33] During his participation with the Wild West show, Sitting Bull met Annie Oakley. He was so impressed with Oakley's skills with firearms that he offered $65 for a photographer to take a photo of the two together.[34] The admiration and respect of was mutual. Oakley stated that Sitting Bull made a \\\"great pet\\\" of her.[35] Over time, Sitting Bull's respect for the young sharpshooter grew. Oakley was quite modest in her attire, deeply respectful of others and had a remarkable stage persona despite being a woman who stood only five feet in height. Sitting Bull felt that she was \\\"gifted\\\" by supernatural means in order to shoot so accurately with both hands. As a result of his esteem, he adopted her as a daughter in 1884. He named her \\\"Little Sure Shot\\\" -- a name that Oakley used throughout her career.[36] Sitting Bull stayed with the show for four months before returning home. During that time, audiences began to consider him a celebrity and a romanticized warrior. He earned a small fortune by charging for his autograph and picture, although he often gave his money away to the homeless and beggars.[37] Conversion[edit] In 1883, rumors floated that Sitting Bull had been baptized into the Catholic Church. James McLaughlin, Indian agent at Standing Rock Agency, dismissed these reports, saying that \\\"The reported baptism of Sitting-Bull is erroneous. There is no immediate prospect of such ceremony so far as I am aware.\\\" [38][39][40] Death and burial[edit]     \\\"Wild scene\\\", \\\"Squaws death chant heard in every direction\\\"       Monument at Sitting Bull's grave, Mobridge, South Dakota, 2003   Sitting Bull returned to the Standing Rock Agency after working in Buffalo Bill's Wild West Show. In 1890, James McLaughlin, the U.S. Indian Agent at Fort Yates on Standing Rock Agency, feared that the Lakota leader was about to flee the reservation with the Ghost Dancers, so he ordered the police to arrest him.[41] On December 14, 1890, McLaughlin drafted a letter to Lt. Henry Bullhead that included instructions and a plan to capture the chief. The plan called for the arrest to take place at dawn on December 15, and advised the use of a light spring wagon to facilitate the chief's removal before his followers could rally. Bullhead decided against using the wagon. He intended to have the police officers force Sitting Bull to mount a horse immediately after the arrest.[42] Around 5:30 a.m. on December 15, 39 police officers and four volunteers approached Sitting Bull's house. They surrounded the house, knocked and entered. Bullhead told Sitting Bull that he was under arrest and led him outside.[43] The camp awakened and men converged at the house of their chief. As Bullhead ordered Sitting Bull to mount a horse, he explained that the Indian Affairs agent needed to see him and then he could return to his house. Sitting Bull refused to comply and the police used force on him. The Sioux in the village were enraged. A Sioux known as Catch-the-Bear shouldered his rifle and shot Bullhead who, in return, fired his revolver into the chest of Sitting Bull.[44] Another police officer, Red Tomahawk, shot Sitting Bull in the head, and the chief dropped to the ground. He died between 12 and 1 p.m.[citation needed] A close-quarters fight erupted, and within minutes several men were dead. Six policemen were killed immediately and two more died shortly after the fight. Sitting Bull and seven of his supporters lay dead, along with two horses.[45] Sitting Bull's body was taken to Fort Yates to be placed in a coffin (made by the Army carpenter)[46] and for burial. In 1953 Lakota family members exhumed what they believed to be his remains, to be reinterred near Mobridge, South Dakota, his birthplace.[47][48] Legacy[edit]     Sitting Bull, 1882   Following Sitting Bull's death, his cabin on the Grand River was taken to Chicago to become an exhibit at the 1893 World's Columbian Exposition. Native American dancers also performed at the Exposition.[49] Sitting Bull was the subject of, or a featured character in, several Hollywood motion pictures and documentaries. Among them are:  Sitting Bull: The Hostile Sioux Indian Chief (1914) Sitting Bull at the Spirit Lake Massacre (1927) Annie Get Your Gun (1950) Sitting Bull (1954) Buffalo Bill and the Indians, or Sitting Bull's History Lesson (1976) Into the West (2005) Bury My Heart at Wounded Knee (2007) Sitting Bull: A Stone in My Heart (2008) Documentary [50]  As time passed, Sitting Bull became a symbol and archetype of Native American resistance movements as well as a figure celebrated by his former enemies:  On September 14, 1989, the United States Postal Service released a Great Americans series 28 postage stamp featuring a likeness of Sitting Bull.[51] On March 6, 1996, Standing Rock College was renamed Sitting Bull College in his honor. Sitting Bull College serves as an institution of higher education on Sitting Bull's home of Standing Rock in North Dakota and South Dakota. The American historian Gary Clayton Anderson of the University of Oklahoma published Sitting Bull and the Paradox of Lakota Nationhood a revisionist examination of the Lakota medicine man. Anderson stresses the Little Big Horn not so much as a mishap by Custer but in light of past succeses the Lakota Nation and the merits of Sitting Bull himself.[52] Legoland Billund, the first Legoland park, contains a Lego sculpture of Sitting Bull, the largest sculpture in the park. Sitting Bull is featured as the leader for the Native American Civilization in the computer game Civilization IV.[53] Sitting Bull is lionized as one of 13 great Americans in President Barack Obama's children's book, Of Thee I Sing: A Letter to My Daughters.[54] In August 2010, a research team led by Eske Willerslev, an ancient DNA expert at the University of Copenhagen, announced their intention to sequence the genome of Sitting Bull, with the approval of his descendents using a hair sample obtained during his lifetime.[55]  Gallery[edit]        Sitting Bull's grave at Fort Yates, ca. 1906          Sitting Bull and Buffalo Bill in 1885          Sitting Bull in Pierre, South Dakota on his way to Standing Rock Agency from Fort Randall          Sitting Bull (Tatonka-I-Yatanka), a Hunkpapa Sioux, 1885     See also[edit]  Black Elk Henry Mabb Catherine Weldon  Footnotes[edit]   ^ Encyclopdia Britannica 20. 1955. p.723. ^ New Lakota Dictionary, 2008 ^ Kehoe, Alice (2006).

He was killed by Indian agency police on the Standing Rock Indian Reservation during an attempt to arrest him at a time when authorities feared that he would join the Ghost Dance movement.[3] Before the Battle of the Little Bighorn, Sitting Bull had a vision in which he saw the defeat of the 7th Cavalry under Lt. Col. George Armstrong Custer on June 25, 1876. Sitting Bull's leadership motivated his people to a major victory. Months after their victory at the battle, Sitting Bull and his group left the United States for Wood Mountain, Saskatchewan, where he remained until 1881, at which time he surrendered to U.S. forces. A small remnant of his band under Chief Wabl  decided to stay at Wood Mountain. After working as a performer, Sitting Bull returned to the Standing Rock Agency in South Dakota. Because of fears that he would use his influence to support the Ghost Dance movement, Indian Service agent James McLaughlin at Fort Yates ordered his arrest. During an ensuing struggle between Sitting Bull's followers and the agency police, Sitting Bull was shot in the side and head by Standing Rock policemen Lieutenant Bull Head (Tatankapah) and Red Tomahawk (Marcelus Chankpidutah) after the police were fired upon by Sitting Bull's supporters. His body was taken to nearby Fort Yates for burial, but in 1953, his remains were possibly exhumed and reburied near Mobridge, South Dakota, by his Lakota family, who wanted his body to be nearer to his birthplace.

Despite being embroiled in the American Civil War, the United States Army retaliated in 1863 and 1864, even against bands which had not been involved in the hostilities.[8] In 1864, two brigades of about 2200 soldiers under Brigadier General Alfred Sully attacked a village. The defenders were led by Sitting Bull, Gall and Inkpaduta.[8] The Sioux were driven out, but skirmishing continued into August.[citation needed] In September, Sitting Bull and about 100 Hunkpapa Sioux came across a small party near what is now Marmarth, North Dakota. They had been left behind by a wagon train commanded by Captain James L. Fisk to effect some repairs to an overturned wagon. When he led an attack, Sitting Bull was shot in the left hip by a soldier.[8] The bullet exited out through the small of his back, and the wound was not too serious.[9] Red Cloud's War[edit] Sitting Bull led numerous war parties against Fort Berthold, Fort Stevenson, and Fort Buford and their environs from 1865 through 1868.[10] Although Red Cloud was a leader of the Oglala Sioux, his leadership and attacks against forts in the Powder River Country of Montana were supported by Sitting Bull's guerrilla attacks on emigrant parties and smaller forts throughout the upper Missouri River region.[citation needed] By early 1868, the U.S. government desired a peaceful settlement to Red Cloud's War. It agreed to Red Cloud's demands that Forts Phil Kearny and C.F. Smith be abandoned. Chief Gall of the Hunkpapas (among other representatives of the Hunkpapas, Blackfeet, and Yankton Sioux) signed a form of the Treaty of Fort Laramie on July 2, 1868 at Fort Rice (near Bismarck, North Dakota).[11] Sitting Bull did not agree to the treaty. He continued his hit-and-run attacks on forts in the upper Missouri area throughout the late 1860s and early 1870s.[12] The events of 1868 mark a historically debated period of Sitting Bull's life. According to historian Stanley Vestal, who conducted interviews with surviving Hunkpapa in 1930, Sitting Bull was made \\\"Supreme Chief of the whole Sioux Nation\\\" at this time. Later historians and ethnologists have refuted this concept of authority, as the Lakota society was highly decentralised. Lakota bands and their elders made individual decisions.[13] The Great Sioux War of 1876[edit] For more details on this topic, see Great Sioux War of 1876.     Early Cabinet card of Sitting Bull, 1881.   Sitting Bull's band of Hunkpapa continued to attack migrating parties and forts in the late 1860s. When in 1871 the Northern Pacific Railway conducted a survey for a route across the northern plains directly through Hunkpapa lands, it encountered stiff Sioux resistance.[14] The same railway people returned the following year accompanied by federal troops. Sitting Bull and the Hunkpapa attacked the survey party, which was forced to turn back.[15] In 1873, the military accompaniment for the surveyors was increased again, but Sitting Bull's forces resisted the survey \\\"most vigorously.\\\"[16] The Panic of 1873 forced the Northern Pacific Railway's backers (such as Jay Cooke) into bankruptcy. This halted construction of the railroad through Sioux territory. After the discovery and new wealth from gold in California, other men became interested in the potential for gold mining in the Black Hills. In 1874, Lt. Col. George Armstrong Custer led a military expedition from Fort Abraham Lincoln near Bismarck, to explore the Black Hills for gold and to determine a suitable location for a military fort in the Hills.[17] Custer's announcement of gold in the Black Hills triggered the Black Hills Gold Rush. Tensions increased between the Sioux and European Americans' seeking to move into the Black Hills.[18] Although Sitting Bull did not attack Custer's expedition in 1874, the US government was increasingly pressured to open the Black Hills to mining and settlement. It was alarmed at reports of Sioux depredations (encouraged by Sitting Bull). In November 1875, the government ordered all Sioux bands outside the Great Sioux Reservation to move onto the reservation, knowing full well that not all would comply. As of February 1, 1876, the Interior Department certified as \\\"hostile\\\" those bands who continued to live off the reservation.[19] This certification allowed the military to pursue Sitting Bull and other Lakota bands as \\\"hostiles\\\". According to the historian Margot Liberty, many Lakota bands allied with the Cheyenne during the Plains Wars because they thought the other nation was under attack by the US. Given this connection, she suggests the major war should have been called \\\"The Great Cheyenne War\\\". Since 1860, the Northern Cheyenne had led several battles among the Plains Indians. Before 1876, the US Army had destroyed seven Cheyenne camps, more than those of any other nation.[20] However, other historians such as Robert M. Utley[21] and Jerome Greene[22][23] also use Lakota oral testimony as the basis for their conclusions that the Lakota coalition, of which Sitting Bull was the ostensible head, was the primary target of the federal government's pacification campaign. Battle of the Little Bighorn[edit] For more details on this topic, see Battle of the Little Bighorn.     Little Bighorn battlefield   During the period 18681876, Sitting Bull developed into the most important of Native American chiefs. After the Treaty of Fort Laramie (1868) and the creation of the Great Sioux Reservation, many traditional Sioux warriors, such as Red Cloud of the Oglala and Spotted Tail of the Brul, moved to reside permanently on the reservations. They were largely dependent for subsistence on the US Indian agencies. Many other chiefs, including members of Sitting Bull's Hunkpapa band such as Gall, at times lived temporarily at the agencies. They needed the supplies at a time when white encroachment and the depletion of buffalo herds reduced their resources and challenged Native American independence.[citation needed] In 1875, the Northern Cheyenne, Hunkpapa, Oglala, Sans Arc, and Minneconjou camped together for a Sun Dance, with both the Cheyenne medicine man White Bull or Ice and Sitting Bull in association. This ceremonial alliance preceded their fighting together in 1876.[20] Sitting Bull had a major revelation.  At the climactic moment, \\\"Sitting Bull intoned, 'The Great Spirit has given our enemies to us. We are to destroy them. We do not know who they are. They may be soldiers.' Ice too observed, 'No one then knew who the enemy were  of what tribe.'...They were soon to find out.\\\"(Utley 1992: 12224)  Sitting Bull's refusal to adopt any dependence on the white man meant that at times he and his small band of warriors lived isolated on the Plains. When Native Americans were threatened by the United States, numerous members from various Sioux bands and other tribes, such as the North Cheyenne, came to Sitting Bull's camp. His reputation for \\\"strong medicine\\\" developed as he continued to evade the European Americans.     Sketch of Sitting Bull; Harper's Weekly, December 8, 1877 issue.   After the January 1st ultimatum of 1876, when the US Army began to track down Sioux and others living off the reservation as hostiles, Native Americans gathered at Sitting Bull's camp. The chief took an active role in encouraging this \\\"unity camp\\\". He sent scouts to the reservations to recruit warriors, and told the Hunkpapa to share supplies with those Native Americans who joined them. An example of his generosity was Sitting Bull's taking care of Wooden Leg's Northern Cheyenne tribe. They had been impoverished by Captain Reynold's March 17, 1876 attack and fled to Sitting Bull's camp for safety.[20] The Hunkpapa chief provided resources to sustain the new recruits. Over the course of the first half of 1876, Sitting Bull's camp continually expanded, as natives joined him for safety in numbers. His leadership had attracted the warriors and families of an extensive village, estimated at more than 10,000 people. Lt. Col. Custer came across this large camp on June 25, 1876. Sitting Bull did not take a direct military role in the ensuing battle; instead he acted as a spiritual chief and had performed the Sun Dance, in which he fasted and sacrificed over 100 pieces of flesh from his arms, a week prior to the attack.[4] Custers 7th Cavalry advance party attacked Cheyenne and Lakota tribes at their camp on the Little Big Horn River (known as the Greasy Grass River to the Lakota) on June 25, 1876. The U.S. Army did not realize how large the camp was. More than 2,000 Native American warriors had left their reservations to follow Sitting Bull. Inspired by a vision of Sitting Bulls, in which he saw U.S. soldiers being killed as they entered the tribes camp, the Cheyenne and Lakota fought back. Custer's badly outnumbered troops lost ground quickly and were forced to retreat. The tribes led a counter-attack against the soldiers on a nearby ridge, ultimately annihilating them.[24] The Native Americans' victory celebrations were short-lived. Public shock and outrage at Custer's death and defeat, and the government's knowledge about the remaining Sioux, led them to assign thousands more soldiers to the area. Over the next year, the new American military forces pursued the Lakota, forcing many of the Native Americans to surrender. Sitting Bull refused to surrender and in May 1877 led his band across the border into Saskatchewan, Canada. He remained in exile for four years near Wood Mountain, refusing a pardon and the chance to return.[25] When crossing the border into Saskatchewan, Sitting Bull was met by the Canadian Mounties of the region. During this meeting, James Morrow Walsh, commander of the North-West Mounted Police, explained to Sitting Bull that the Lakota were now on British soil and must obey British law. Walsh emphasized that he enforced the law equally and that every person in the territory had a right to justice. Walsh became an advocate for Sitting Bull and the two became good friends for the remainder of their lives.[26] Also while in Canada Sitting Bull met with chief Crowfoot, who was a chief of the Blackfeet, long-time powerful enemies of the Lakota and Cheyenne. Sitting Bull wished to make peace with the Blackfeet Nation and Crowfoot. Being an advocate for peace himself, Crowfoot eagerly accepted the tobacco peace offering. Sitting Bull was so impressed by the Blackfeet chief that he named one of his sons after him.[27] Sitting Bull and his men only stayed in Canada for 4 years. Due to the smaller size of the buffalo herds in Canada, Sitting Bull and his men found it difficult to find enough food to feed his people, who were starving and exhausted. Furthermore, due to Sitting Bulls presence in the country, there had been a growth in tension between the Canadian and the United States governments.[28] Before Sitting Bull left Saskatchewan, he may have visited Walsh for a final time and left a ceremonial headdress as a memento.[29] Surrender[edit]     Fort Buford's original 1872 Commanding Officer's Quarters where Sitting Bull's surrender ceremony was held   Hunger and desperation eventually forced Sitting Bull, and 186 of his family and followers to return to the United States and surrender on July 19, 1881. Sitting Bull had his young son Crow Foot surrender his Winchester lever-action carbine to Major David H. Brotherton, commanding officer of Fort Buford in the parlor of the Commanding Officer's Quarters in a ceremony the next day. He told the 4 soldiers, 20 warriors and other guests in the small room, that he wished to regard the soldiers and the white race as friends but he wanted to know who would teach his son the new ways of the world. Two weeks later, after waiting in vain for other members of his tribe to follow him from Canada, the Army transferred Sitting Bull and his band to Fort Yates, the military post located adjacent to the Standing Rock Agency, which straddles the present-day boundary of North and South Dakota.[citation needed] Sitting Bull and his band of 186 people were kept separate from the other Hunkpapa gathered at the agency. Army officials were concerned that the famed chief would stir up trouble among the recently surrendered northern bands. On August 26, 1881, he was visited by the census taker William T. Selwyn, who counted twelve people in the Hunkpapa leader's immediate family. Forty-one families, totaling 195 people, were recorded in Sitting Bull's band.[30] The military decided to transfer him and his band to Fort Randall, to be held as prisoners of war. Loaded onto a steamboat, the band of 172 people was sent down the Missouri River to Fort Randall (near present-day Pickstown, South Dakota on the southern border of the state). There they spent the next 20 months. They were allowed to return north to the Standing Rock Agency in May 1883.[citation needed] Wild West Show participation[edit] In 1885, Sitting Bull was allowed to leave the reservation to go Wild Westing with Buffalo Bill Codys Buffalo Bill's Wild West. He got about $50 a week for riding once around the arena, where he was a popular attraction. Although it is rumored that he cursed his audiences in his native tongue during the show, the historian Utley contends that he did not.[31] Historians have reported that Sitting Bull gave speeches about his desire for education for the young, and reconciling relations between the Sioux and whites.[32] The historian Edward Lazarus wrote that Sitting Bull reportedly cursed his audience in Lakota in 1884, during an opening address celebrating the completion of the Northern Pacific Railway.[33] During his participation with the Wild West show, Sitting Bull met Annie Oakley. He was so impressed with Oakley's skills with firearms that he offered $65 for a photographer to take a photo of the two together.[34] The admiration and respect of was mutual. Oakley stated that Sitting Bull made a \\\"great pet\\\" of her.[35] Over time, Sitting Bull's respect for the young sharpshooter grew. Oakley was quite modest in her attire, deeply respectful of others and had a remarkable stage persona despite being a woman who stood only five feet in height. Sitting Bull felt that she was \\\"gifted\\\" by supernatural means in order to shoot so accurately with both hands. As a result of his esteem, he adopted her as a daughter in 1884. He named her \\\"Little Sure Shot\\\" -- a name that Oakley used throughout her career.[36] Sitting Bull stayed with the show for four months before returning home. During that time, audiences began to consider him a celebrity and a romanticized warrior. He earned a small fortune by charging for his autograph and picture, although he often gave his money away to the homeless and beggars.[37] Conversion[edit] In 1883, rumors floated that Sitting Bull had been baptized into the Catholic Church. James McLaughlin, Indian agent at Standing Rock Agency, dismissed these reports, saying that \\\"The reported baptism of Sitting-Bull is erroneous. There is no immediate prospect of such ceremony so far as I am aware.\\\" [38][39][40] Death and burial[edit]     \\\"Wild scene\\\", \\\"Squaws death chant heard in every direction\\\"       Monument at Sitting Bull's grave, Mobridge, South Dakota, 2003   Sitting Bull returned to the Standing Rock Agency after working in Buffalo Bill's Wild West Show. In 1890, James McLaughlin, the U.S. Indian Agent at Fort Yates on Standing Rock Agency, feared that the Lakota leader was about to flee the reservation with the Ghost Dancers, so he ordered the police to arrest him.[41] On December 14, 1890, McLaughlin drafted a letter to Lt. Henry Bullhead that included instructions and a plan to capture the chief. The plan called for the arrest to take place at dawn on December 15, and advised the use of a light spring wagon to facilitate the chief's removal before his followers could rally. Bullhead decided against using the wagon. He intended to have the police officers force Sitting Bull to mount a horse immediately after the arrest.[42] Around 5:30 a.m. on December 15, 39 police officers and four volunteers approached Sitting Bull's house. They surrounded the house, knocked and entered. Bullhead told Sitting Bull that he was under arrest and led him outside.[43] The camp awakened and men converged at the house of their chief. As Bullhead ordered Sitting Bull to mount a horse, he explained that the Indian Affairs agent needed to see him and then he could return to his house. Sitting Bull refused to comply and the police used force on him. The Sioux in the village were enraged. A Sioux known as Catch-the-Bear shouldered his rifle and shot Bullhead who, in return, fired his revolver into the chest of Sitting Bull.[44] Another police officer, Red Tomahawk, shot Sitting Bull in the head, and the chief dropped to the ground. He died between 12 and 1 p.m.[citation needed] A close-quarters fight erupted, and within minutes several men were dead. Six policemen were killed immediately and two more died shortly after the fight. Sitting Bull and seven of his supporters lay dead, along with two horses.[45] Sitting Bull's body was taken to Fort Yates to be placed in a coffin (made by the Army carpenter)[46] and for burial. In 1953 Lakota family members exhumed what they believed to be his remains, to be reinterred near Mobridge, South Dakota, his birthplace.[47][48] Legacy[edit]     Sitting Bull, 1882   Following Sitting Bull's death, his cabin on the Grand River was taken to Chicago to become an exhibit at the 1893 World's Columbian Exposition. Native American dancers also performed at the Exposition.[49] Sitting Bull was the subject of, or a featured character in, several Hollywood motion pictures and documentaries. Among them are:  Sitting Bull: The Hostile Sioux Indian Chief (1914) Sitting Bull at the Spirit Lake Massacre (1927) Annie Get Your Gun (1950) Sitting Bull (1954) Buffalo Bill and the Indians, or Sitting Bull's History Lesson (1976) Into the West (2005) Bury My Heart at Wounded Knee (2007) Sitting Bull: A Stone in My Heart (2008) Documentary [50]  As time passed, Sitting Bull became a symbol and archetype of Native American resistance movements as well as a figure celebrated by his former enemies:  On September 14, 1989, the United States Postal Service released a Great Americans series 28 postage stamp featuring a likeness of Sitting Bull.[51] On March 6, 1996, Standing Rock College was renamed Sitting Bull College in his honor. Sitting Bull College serves as an institution of higher education on Sitting Bull's home of Standing Rock in North Dakota and South Dakota. The American historian Gary Clayton Anderson of the University of Oklahoma published Sitting Bull and the Paradox of Lakota Nationhood a revisionist examination of the Lakota medicine man. Anderson stresses the Little Big Horn not so much as a mishap by Custer but in light of past succeses the Lakota Nation and the merits of Sitting Bull himself.[52] Legoland Billund, the first Legoland park, contains a Lego sculpture of Sitting Bull, the largest sculpture in the park. Sitting Bull is featured as the leader for the Native American Civilization in the computer game Civilization IV.[53] Sitting Bull is lionized as one of 13 great Americans in President Barack Obama's children's book, Of Thee I Sing: A Letter to My Daughters.[54] In August 2010, a research team led by Eske Willerslev, an ancient DNA expert at the University of Copenhagen, announced their intention to sequence the genome of Sitting Bull, with the approval of his descendents using a hair sample obtained during his lifetime.[55]  Gallery[edit]        Sitting Bull's grave at Fort Yates, ca. 1906          Sitting Bull and Buffalo Bill in 1885          Sitting Bull in Pierre, South Dakota on his way to Standing Rock Agency from Fort Randall          Sitting Bull (Tatonka-I-Yatanka), a Hunkpapa Sioux, 1885     See also[edit]  Black Elk Henry Mabb Catherine Weldon  Footnotes[edit]   ^ Encyclopdia Britannica 20. 1955. p.723. ^ New Lakota Dictionary, 2008 ^ Kehoe, Alice (2006).

He was killed by Indian agency police on the Standing Rock Indian Reservation during an attempt to arrest him at a time when authorities feared that he would join the Ghost Dance movement.[3] Before the Battle of the Little Bighorn, Sitting Bull had a vision in which he saw the defeat of the 7th Cavalry under Lt. Col. George Armstrong Custer on June 25, 1876. Sitting Bull's leadership motivated his people to a major victory. Months after their victory at the battle, Sitting Bull and his group left the United States for Wood Mountain, Saskatchewan, where he remained until 1881, at which time he surrendered to U.S. forces. A small remnant of his band under Chief Wabl  decided to stay at Wood Mountain. After working as a performer, Sitting Bull returned to the Standing Rock Agency in South Dakota. Because of fears that he would use his influence to support the Ghost Dance movement, Indian Service agent James McLaughlin at Fort Yates ordered his arrest. During an ensuing struggle between Sitting Bull's followers and the agency police, Sitting Bull was shot in the side and head by Standing Rock policemen Lieutenant Bull Head (Tatankapah) and Red Tomahawk (Marcelus Chankpidutah) after the police were fired upon by Sitting Bull's supporters. His body was taken to nearby Fort Yates for burial, but in 1953, his remains were possibly exhumed and reburied near Mobridge, South Dakota, by his Lakota family, who wanted his body to be nearer to his birthplace.

Despite being embroiled in the American Civil War, the United States Army retaliated in 1863 and 1864, even against bands which had not been involved in the hostilities.[8] In 1864, two brigades of about 2200 soldiers under Brigadier General Alfred Sully attacked a village. The defenders were led by Sitting Bull, Gall and Inkpaduta.[8] The Sioux were driven out, but skirmishing continued into August.[citation needed] In September, Sitting Bull and about 100 Hunkpapa Sioux came across a small party near what is now Marmarth, North Dakota. They had been left behind by a wagon train commanded by Captain James L. Fisk to effect some repairs to an overturned wagon. When he led an attack, Sitting Bull was shot in the left hip by a soldier.[8] The bullet exited out through the small of his back, and the wound was not too serious.[9] Red Cloud's War[edit] Sitting Bull led numerous war parties against Fort Berthold, Fort Stevenson, and Fort Buford and their environs from 1865 through 1868.[10] Although Red Cloud was a leader of the Oglala Sioux, his leadership and attacks against forts in the Powder River Country of Montana were supported by Sitting Bull's guerrilla attacks on emigrant parties and smaller forts throughout the upper Missouri River region.[citation needed] By early 1868, the U.S. government desired a peaceful settlement to Red Cloud's War. It agreed to Red Cloud's demands that Forts Phil Kearny and C.F. Smith be abandoned. Chief Gall of the Hunkpapas (among other representatives of the Hunkpapas, Blackfeet, and Yankton Sioux) signed a form of the Treaty of Fort Laramie on July 2, 1868 at Fort Rice (near Bismarck, North Dakota).[11] Sitting Bull did not agree to the treaty. He continued his hit-and-run attacks on forts in the upper Missouri area throughout the late 1860s and early 1870s.[12] The events of 1868 mark a historically debated period of Sitting Bull's life. According to historian Stanley Vestal, who conducted interviews with surviving Hunkpapa in 1930, Sitting Bull was made \\\"Supreme Chief of the whole Sioux Nation\\\" at this time. Later historians and ethnologists have refuted this concept of authority, as the Lakota society was highly decentralised. Lakota bands and their elders made individual decisions.[13] The Great Sioux War of 1876[edit] For more details on this topic, see Great Sioux War of 1876.     Early Cabinet card of Sitting Bull, 1881.   Sitting Bull's band of Hunkpapa continued to attack migrating parties and forts in the late 1860s. When in 1871 the Northern Pacific Railway conducted a survey for a route across the northern plains directly through Hunkpapa lands, it encountered stiff Sioux resistance.[14] The same railway people returned the following year accompanied by federal troops. Sitting Bull and the Hunkpapa attacked the survey party, which was forced to turn back.[15] In 1873, the military accompaniment for the surveyors was increased again, but Sitting Bull's forces resisted the survey \\\"most vigorously.\\\"[16] The Panic of 1873 forced the Northern Pacific Railway's backers (such as Jay Cooke) into bankruptcy. This halted construction of the railroad through Sioux territory. After the discovery and new wealth from gold in California, other men became interested in the potential for gold mining in the Black Hills. In 1874, Lt. Col. George Armstrong Custer led a military expedition from Fort Abraham Lincoln near Bismarck, to explore the Black Hills for gold and to determine a suitable location for a military fort in the Hills.[17] Custer's announcement of gold in the Black Hills triggered the Black Hills Gold Rush. Tensions increased between the Sioux and European Americans' seeking to move into the Black Hills.[18] Although Sitting Bull did not attack Custer's expedition in 1874, the US government was increasingly pressured to open the Black Hills to mining and settlement. It was alarmed at reports of Sioux depredations (encouraged by Sitting Bull). In November 1875, the government ordered all Sioux bands outside the Great Sioux Reservation to move onto the reservation, knowing full well that not all would comply. As of February 1, 1876, the Interior Department certified as \\\"hostile\\\" those bands who continued to live off the reservation.[19] This certification allowed the military to pursue Sitting Bull and other Lakota bands as \\\"hostiles\\\". According to the historian Margot Liberty, many Lakota bands allied with the Cheyenne during the Plains Wars because they thought the other nation was under attack by the US. Given this connection, she suggests the major war should have been called \\\"The Great Cheyenne War\\\". Since 1860, the Northern Cheyenne had led several battles among the Plains Indians. Before 1876, the US Army had destroyed seven Cheyenne camps, more than those of any other nation.[20] However, other historians such as Robert M. Utley[21] and Jerome Greene[22][23] also use Lakota oral testimony as the basis for their conclusions that the Lakota coalition, of which Sitting Bull was the ostensible head, was the primary target of the federal government's pacification campaign. Battle of the Little Bighorn[edit] For more details on this topic, see Battle of the Little Bighorn.     Little Bighorn battlefield   During the period 18681876, Sitting Bull developed into the most important of Native American chiefs. After the Treaty of Fort Laramie (1868) and the creation of the Great Sioux Reservation, many traditional Sioux warriors, such as Red Cloud of the Oglala and Spotted Tail of the Brul, moved to reside permanently on the reservations. They were largely dependent for subsistence on the US Indian agencies. Many other chiefs, including members of Sitting Bull's Hunkpapa band such as Gall, at times lived temporarily at the agencies. They needed the supplies at a time when white encroachment and the depletion of buffalo herds reduced their resources and challenged Native American independence.[citation needed] In 1875, the Northern Cheyenne, Hunkpapa, Oglala, Sans Arc, and Minneconjou camped together for a Sun Dance, with both the Cheyenne medicine man White Bull or Ice and Sitting Bull in association. This ceremonial alliance preceded their fighting together in 1876.[20] Sitting Bull had a major revelation.  At the climactic moment, \\\"Sitting Bull intoned, 'The Great Spirit has given our enemies to us. We are to destroy them. We do not know who they are. They may be soldiers.' Ice too observed, 'No one then knew who the enemy were  of what tribe.'...They were soon to find out.\\\"(Utley 1992: 12224)  Sitting Bull's refusal to adopt any dependence on the white man meant that at times he and his small band of warriors lived isolated on the Plains. When Native Americans were threatened by the United States, numerous members from various Sioux bands and other tribes, such as the North Cheyenne, came to Sitting Bull's camp. His reputation for \\\"strong medicine\\\" developed as he continued to evade the European Americans.     Sketch of Sitting Bull; Harper's Weekly, December 8, 1877 issue.   After the January 1st ultimatum of 1876, when the US Army began to track down Sioux and others living off the reservation as hostiles, Native Americans gathered at Sitting Bull's camp. The chief took an active role in encouraging this \\\"unity camp\\\". He sent scouts to the reservations to recruit warriors, and told the Hunkpapa to share supplies with those Native Americans who joined them. An example of his generosity was Sitting Bull's taking care of Wooden Leg's Northern Cheyenne tribe. They had been impoverished by Captain Reynold's March 17, 1876 attack and fled to Sitting Bull's camp for safety.[20] The Hunkpapa chief provided resources to sustain the new recruits. Over the course of the first half of 1876, Sitting Bull's camp continually expanded, as natives joined him for safety in numbers. His leadership had attracted the warriors and families of an extensive village, estimated at more than 10,000 people. Lt. Col. Custer came across this large camp on June 25, 1876. Sitting Bull did not take a direct military role in the ensuing battle; instead he acted as a spiritual chief and had performed the Sun Dance, in which he fasted and sacrificed over 100 pieces of flesh from his arms, a week prior to the attack.[4] Custers 7th Cavalry advance party attacked Cheyenne and Lakota tribes at their camp on the Little Big Horn River (known as the Greasy Grass River to the Lakota) on June 25, 1876. The U.S. Army did not realize how large the camp was. More than 2,000 Native American warriors had left their reservations to follow Sitting Bull. Inspired by a vision of Sitting Bulls, in which he saw U.S. soldiers being killed as they entered the tribes camp, the Cheyenne and Lakota fought back. Custer's badly outnumbered troops lost ground quickly and were forced to retreat. The tribes led a counter-attack against the soldiers on a nearby ridge, ultimately annihilating them.[24] The Native Americans' victory celebrations were short-lived. Public shock and outrage at Custer's death and defeat, and the government's knowledge about the remaining Sioux, led them to assign thousands more soldiers to the area. Over the next year, the new American military forces pursued the Lakota, forcing many of the Native Americans to surrender. Sitting Bull refused to surrender and in May 1877 led his band across the border into Saskatchewan, Canada. He remained in exile for four years near Wood Mountain, refusing a pardon and the chance to return.[25] When crossing the border into Saskatchewan, Sitting Bull was met by the Canadian Mounties of the region. During this meeting, James Morrow Walsh, commander of the North-West Mounted Police, explained to Sitting Bull that the Lakota were now on British soil and must obey British law. Walsh emphasized that he enforced the law equally and that every person in the territory had a right to justice. Walsh became an advocate for Sitting Bull and the two became good friends for the remainder of their lives.[26] Also while in Canada Sitting Bull met with chief Crowfoot, who was a chief of the Blackfeet, long-time powerful enemies of the Lakota and Cheyenne. Sitting Bull wished to make peace with the Blackfeet Nation and Crowfoot. Being an advocate for peace himself, Crowfoot eagerly accepted the tobacco peace offering. Sitting Bull was so impressed by the Blackfeet chief that he named one of his sons after him.[27] Sitting Bull and his men only stayed in Canada for 4 years. Due to the smaller size of the buffalo herds in Canada, Sitting Bull and his men found it difficult to find enough food to feed his people, who were starving and exhausted. Furthermore, due to Sitting Bulls presence in the country, there had been a growth in tension between the Canadian and the United States governments.[28] Before Sitting Bull left Saskatchewan, he may have visited Walsh for a final time and left a ceremonial headdress as a memento.[29] Surrender[edit]     Fort Buford's original 1872 Commanding Officer's Quarters where Sitting Bull's surrender ceremony was held   Hunger and desperation eventually forced Sitting Bull, and 186 of his family and followers to return to the United States and surrender on July 19, 1881. Sitting Bull had his young son Crow Foot surrender his Winchester lever-action carbine to Major David H. Brotherton, commanding officer of Fort Buford in the parlor of the Commanding Officer's Quarters in a ceremony the next day. He told the 4 soldiers, 20 warriors and other guests in the small room, that he wished to regard the soldiers and the white race as friends but he wanted to know who would teach his son the new ways of the world. Two weeks later, after waiting in vain for other members of his tribe to follow him from Canada, the Army transferred Sitting Bull and his band to Fort Yates, the military post located adjacent to the Standing Rock Agency, which straddles the present-day boundary of North and South Dakota.[citation needed] Sitting Bull and his band of 186 people were kept separate from the other Hunkpapa gathered at the agency. Army officials were concerned that the famed chief would stir up trouble among the recently surrendered northern bands. On August 26, 1881, he was visited by the census taker William T. Selwyn, who counted twelve people in the Hunkpapa leader's immediate family. Forty-one families, totaling 195 people, were recorded in Sitting Bull's band.[30] The military decided to transfer him and his band to Fort Randall, to be held as prisoners of war. Loaded onto a steamboat, the band of 172 people was sent down the Missouri River to Fort Randall (near present-day Pickstown, South Dakota on the southern border of the state). There they spent the next 20 months. They were allowed to return north to the Standing Rock Agency in May 1883.[citation needed] Wild West Show participation[edit] In 1885, Sitting Bull was allowed to leave the reservation to go Wild Westing with Buffalo Bill Codys Buffalo Bill's Wild West. He got about $50 a week for riding once around the arena, where he was a popular attraction. Although it is rumored that he cursed his audiences in his native tongue during the show, the historian Utley contends that he did not.[31] Historians have reported that Sitting Bull gave speeches about his desire for education for the young, and reconciling relations between the Sioux and whites.[32] The historian Edward Lazarus wrote that Sitting Bull reportedly cursed his audience in Lakota in 1884, during an opening address celebrating the completion of the Northern Pacific Railway.[33] During his participation with the Wild West show, Sitting Bull met Annie Oakley. He was so impressed with Oakley's skills with firearms that he offered $65 for a photographer to take a photo of the two together.[34] The admiration and respect of was mutual. Oakley stated that Sitting Bull made a \\\"great pet\\\" of her.[35] Over time, Sitting Bull's respect for the young sharpshooter grew. Oakley was quite modest in her attire, deeply respectful of others and had a remarkable stage persona despite being a woman who stood only five feet in height. Sitting Bull felt that she was \\\"gifted\\\" by supernatural means in order to shoot so accurately with both hands. As a result of his esteem, he adopted her as a daughter in 1884. He named her \\\"Little Sure Shot\\\" -- a name that Oakley used throughout her career.[36] Sitting Bull stayed with the show for four months before returning home. During that time, audiences began to consider him a celebrity and a romanticized warrior. He earned a small fortune by charging for his autograph and picture, although he often gave his money away to the homeless and beggars.[37] Conversion[edit] In 1883, rumors floated that Sitting Bull had been baptized into the Catholic Church. James McLaughlin, Indian agent at Standing Rock Agency, dismissed these reports, saying that \\\"The reported baptism of Sitting-Bull is erroneous. There is no immediate prospect of such ceremony so far as I am aware.\\\" [38][39][40] Death and burial[edit]     \\\"Wild scene\\\", \\\"Squaws death chant heard in every direction\\\"       Monument at Sitting Bull's grave, Mobridge, South Dakota, 2003   Sitting Bull returned to the Standing Rock Agency after working in Buffalo Bill's Wild West Show. In 1890, James McLaughlin, the U.S. Indian Agent at Fort Yates on Standing Rock Agency, feared that the Lakota leader was about to flee the reservation with the Ghost Dancers, so he ordered the police to arrest him.[41] On December 14, 1890, McLaughlin drafted a letter to Lt. Henry Bullhead that included instructions and a plan to capture the chief. The plan called for the arrest to take place at dawn on December 15, and advised the use of a light spring wagon to facilitate the chief's removal before his followers could rally. Bullhead decided against using the wagon. He intended to have the police officers force Sitting Bull to mount a horse immediately after the arrest.[42] Around 5:30 a.m. on December 15, 39 police officers and four volunteers approached Sitting Bull's house. They surrounded the house, knocked and entered. Bullhead told Sitting Bull that he was under arrest and led him outside.[43] The camp awakened and men converged at the house of their chief. As Bullhead ordered Sitting Bull to mount a horse, he explained that the Indian Affairs agent needed to see him and then he could return to his house. Sitting Bull refused to comply and the police used force on him. The Sioux in the village were enraged. A Sioux known as Catch-the-Bear shouldered his rifle and shot Bullhead who, in return, fired his revolver into the chest of Sitting Bull.[44] Another police officer, Red Tomahawk, shot Sitting Bull in the head, and the chief dropped to the ground. He died between 12 and 1 p.m.[citation needed] A close-quarters fight erupted, and within minutes several men were dead. Six policemen were killed immediately and two more died shortly after the fight. Sitting Bull and seven of his supporters lay dead, along with two horses.[45] Sitting Bull's body was taken to Fort Yates to be placed in a coffin (made by the Army carpenter)[46] and for burial. In 1953 Lakota family members exhumed what they believed to be his remains, to be reinterred near Mobridge, South Dakota, his birthplace.[47][48] Legacy[edit]     Sitting Bull, 1882   Following Sitting Bull's death, his cabin on the Grand River was taken to Chicago to become an exhibit at the 1893 World's Columbian Exposition. Native American dancers also performed at the Exposition.[49] Sitting Bull was the subject of, or a featured character in, several Hollywood motion pictures and documentaries. Among them are:  Sitting Bull: The Hostile Sioux Indian Chief (1914) Sitting Bull at the Spirit Lake Massacre (1927) Annie Get Your Gun (1950) Sitting Bull (1954) Buffalo Bill and the Indians, or Sitting Bull's History Lesson (1976) Into the West (2005) Bury My Heart at Wounded Knee (2007) Sitting Bull: A Stone in My Heart (2008) Documentary [50]  As time passed, Sitting Bull became a symbol and archetype of Native American resistance movements as well as a figure celebrated by his former enemies:  On September 14, 1989, the United States Postal Service released a Great Americans series 28 postage stamp featuring a likeness of Sitting Bull.[51] On March 6, 1996, Standing Rock College was renamed Sitting Bull College in his honor. Sitting Bull College serves as an institution of higher education on Sitting Bull's home of Standing Rock in North Dakota and South Dakota. The American historian Gary Clayton Anderson of the University of Oklahoma published Sitting Bull and the Paradox of Lakota Nationhood a revisionist examination of the Lakota medicine man. Anderson stresses the Little Big Horn not so much as a mishap by Custer but in light of past succeses the Lakota Nation and the merits of Sitting Bull himself.[52] Legoland Billund, the first Legoland park, contains a Lego sculpture of Sitting Bull, the largest sculpture in the park. Sitting Bull is featured as the leader for the Native American Civilization in the computer game Civilization IV.[53] Sitting Bull is lionized as one of 13 great Americans in President Barack Obama's children's book, Of Thee I Sing: A Letter to My Daughters.[54] In August 2010, a research team led by Eske Willerslev, an ancient DNA expert at the University of Copenhagen, announced their intention to sequence the genome of Sitting Bull, with the approval of his descendents using a hair sample obtained during his lifetime.[55]  Gallery[edit]        Sitting Bull's grave at Fort Yates, ca. 1906          Sitting Bull and Buffalo Bill in 1885          Sitting Bull in Pierre, South Dakota on his way to Standing Rock Agency from Fort Randall          Sitting Bull (Tatonka-I-Yatanka), a Hunkpapa Sioux, 1885     See also[edit]  Black Elk Henry Mabb Catherine Weldon  Footnotes[edit]   ^ Encyclopdia Britannica 20. 1955. p.723. ^ New Lakota Dictionary, 2008 ^ Kehoe, Alice (2006).

This is worth the read!   BEST SUMMATION OF BARACK AND MICHELLE EVER! Mychal Massie is a respected writer and... talk show host in Los Angeles . The other evening on my twitter, a person asked me why I didn't like the Obama's? Specifically I was asked: \\\"I have to ask, why do you hate the Obama's? It seems personal, not policy related. You even dissed (disrespect) their Christmas family picture.\\\"  The truth is I do not like the Obamas, what they represent, their ideology, and I certainly do not like his policies and legislation. I've made no secret of my contempt for the Obamas. As I responded to the person who asked me the aforementioned question, I don't like them because they are committed to the fundamental change of my/our country into what can only be regarded as a Communist state.   I don't hate them per definition, but I condemn them because they are the worst kind of racialists, they are elitist Leninists with contempt for traditional America . They display disrespect for the sanctity of the office he holds, and for those who are willing to admit same, Michelle Obama's raw contempt for white America is transpicuous. I don't like them because they comport themselves as emperor and empress.   I expect, no I demand respect, for the Office of President and a love of our country and her citizenry from the leader entrusted with the governance of same. President and Mrs. Reagan displayed an unparalleled love for the country and her people.   The Reagan's made Americans feel good about themselves and about what we could accomplish. Obama's arrogance by appointing 32 leftist czars and constantly bypassing congress is impeachable. Eric Holder is probably the MOST incompetent and arrogant DOJ head to ever hold the job. Could you envision President Reagan instructing his Justice Department to act like jack-booted thugs?   Presidents are politicians and all politicians are known and pretty much expected to manipulate the truth, if not outright lie, but even using that low standard, the Obama's have taken lies, dishonesty, deceit, mendacity, subterfuge and obfuscation to new depths. They are verbally abusive to the citizenry, and they display an animus for civility.   I do not like them, because they both display bigotry overtly, as in the case of Harvard Professor Louis Gates, when he accused the Cambridge Police of acting stupidly, and her code speak pursuant to not being able to be proud of America . I view that statement and that mindset as an insult to those who died to provide a country where a Kenyan, his illegal alien relatives, and his alleged progeny, could come and not only live freely, but rise to the highest, most powerful, position in the world.   Michelle Obama is free to hate and disparage whites because Americans of every description paid with their blood to ensure her right to do same. I have a saying, that \\\"the only reason a person hides things, is because they have something to hide.\\\" No president in history has spent millions of dollars to keep his records and his past sealed.   And what the two of them have shared has been proved to be lies. He lied about when and how they met, he lied about his mother's death and problems with insurance, Michelle lied to a crowd pursuant to nearly $500,000 bank stocks they inherited from his family. He has lied about his father's military service, about the civil rights movement, ad nausea. He lied to the world about the Supreme Court in a State of the Union address. He berated and publicly insulted a sitting Congressman. He has surrounded himself with the most rabidly, radical, socialist academicians today.   He opposed rulings that protected women and children that even Planned Parenthood did not seek to support. He is openly hostile to business and aggressively hostile to Israel . His wife treats being the First Lady as her personal American Express Black Card (arguably the most prestigious credit card in the world). I condemn them because, as people are suffering, losing their homes, their jobs, their retirements, he and his family are arrogantly showing off their life of entitlement - as he goes about creating and fomenting class warfare.   I don't like them, and I neither apologize nor retreat from my public condemnation of them and of his policies. We should condemn them for the disrespect they show our people, for his willful and unconstitutional actions pursuant to obeying the Constitutional parameters he is bound by, and his willful disregard for Congressional authority.   Dislike for them has nothing to do with the color of their skin; it has everything to do with their behavior, attitudes, and policies. And I have open scorn for their constantly playing the race card.   I could go on, but let me conclude with this. I condemn in the strongest possible terms the media for refusing to investigate them, as they did President Bush and President Clinton, and for refusing to label them for what they truly are. There is no scenario known to man, whereby a white president and his wife could ignore laws, flaunt their position, and lord over the people, as these two are permitted out of fear for their color.   As I wrote in a syndicated column titled, \\\"Nero In The White House\\\" - \\\"Never in my life, inside or outside of politics, have I witnessed such dishonesty in a political leader. He is the most mendacious political figure I have ever witnessed. Even by the low standards of his presidential predecessors, his narcissistic, contumacious arrogance is unequaled. Using Obama as the bar, Nero would have to be elevated to sainthood...   Many in America wanted to be proud when the first person of color was elected president, but instead, they have been witness to a congenital liar, a woman who has been ashamed of America her entire life, failed policies,  intimidation, and a commonality hitherto not witnessed in political leaders. He and his wife view their life at our expense as an entitlement - while America 's people go homeless, hungry and unemployed.\\\"\",\n      \"sentiment\": -5,\n      \"sentiment_reason\": \"Sentiment

and theft of corporate and government secrets by Chinese hackers. www.nytimes.com U.S. and China Agree to Hold Regular Talks on Hacking By DAVID E. SANGER and MARK LANDLER Published: June 1, 2013  WASHINGTON &mdash; The United States and China have agreed to hold regular, high-level talks on how to set standards of behavior for cybersecurity and commercial espionage, the first diplomatic effort to defuse the tensions over what the United States says is a daily barrage of computer break-ins and theft of corporate and government secrets.  The talks will begin in July. Next Friday, President Obama and President Xi Jinping of China, who took office this spring, are scheduled to hold an unusual, informal summit meeting in Rancho Mirage, Calif., that could set the tone for their relationship and help them confront chronic tensions like the nuclear threat from North Korea.   American officials say they do not expect the process to immediately yield a significant reduction in the daily intrusions from China. The head of the United States Cyber Command and director of the National Security Agency, Gen. Keith B. Alexander, has said the attacks have resulted in the &ldquo;greatest transfer of wealth in history.&rdquo; Hackers have stolen a variety of secrets, including negotiating strategies and schematics for next-generation fighter jets and gas pipeline control systems.   Nonetheless, a senior American official involved in the negotiations to hold regular meetings said in an interview on Friday that &ldquo;we need to get some norms and rules.&rdquo;   &ldquo;It is a serious issue that cannot simply be swatted away with talking points,&rdquo; said the official, who noted that the meetings would focus primarily on the theft of intellectual property from American companies. &ldquo;Our concerns are not limited to that, but that&rsquo;s what needs urgent attention,&rdquo; he added.   The Chinese government has insisted it is a victim of cyberattacks, not a perpetrator, and Chinese officials have vigorously denied the extensive evidence gathered by the Pentagon and private security experts that a unit of the People&rsquo;s Liberation Army, Unit 61398 outside Shanghai, is behind many of the most sophisticated attacks on the United States.   On Saturday, after Defense Secretary Chuck Hagel spoke of a &ldquo;growing threat of cyberintrusions&rdquo; at a conference in Singapore, in comments directed at China, a Chinese general gave a tart response saying she doubted the United States&rsquo; assurances that its growing military presence in Asia was not directed at China.   While cyberattacks will be a major subject of the talks in Rancho Mirage, at an estate that belonged to Walter Annenberg, the main effort will be to forge a rapport between Mr. Obama and Mr. Xi. American officials hope the estate, known as Sunnylands, which has played host to American presidents and foreign dignitaries dating to Richard M. Nixon, will put both men at ease.   American officials said they have been surprised by the pace at which Mr. Xi, a longtime party functionary who consolidated his grip on power in March, has installed new faces in the Chinese leadership and moved to take greater control over the military, something his predecessor, Hu Jintao, never mastered.   Another main issue at the meeting will be North Korea. American officials, emerging from talks with Mr. Xi and his team, believe that the new Chinese leader has less patience for North Korea and little of the sentimental attachment to its leaders that his predecessors had.   &ldquo;What&rsquo;s interesting here is the dog that isn&rsquo;t barking,&rdquo; the American official said. The Chinese, he noted, are not urging all sides to resume talks until the North Koreans agree that the objective is removing all nuclear weapons from the Korean Peninsula. &ldquo;We&rsquo;re not hearing the soothing mantra of restraint,&rdquo; he said.   The Chinese have also taken public steps to confront North Korea, like ordering the Bank of China to stop dealing with North Korea&rsquo;s largest foreign-exchange bank.   &ldquo;They&rsquo;re much more open to causing pain to North Korea,&rdquo; said Jeffrey A. Bader, a top China adviser to Mr. Obama until 2011.   Still, during the latest round of the Korea crisis this spring, Kim Jong-un, the young and largely untested new North Korean leader, made it clear that he had no intention of ever giving up his small arsenal.   Cybersecurity issues loom large between the United States and China because they go to the heart of the economic relationship between the two countries, even more so now that previous sources of friction, like China&rsquo;s foreign exchange policies, have eased in the last year.   Chinese academics and industrialists say that if China is to maintain its annual economic growth rate of 7 or 8 percent, it needs a steady inflow of new technology. That could make the Chinese reluctant to cut back on the systematic theft of intellectual property.   In return, the Chinese will press the Americans on their use of cyberweapons: while there is no evidence that they have been used against Chinese targets, the sophisticated cyberattacks on Iran&rsquo;s nuclear program by the United States and Israel are often cited by the Chinese news media and military journals as evidence that Washington, too, uses cyberspace for strategic advantage.   The talks over computer hacking will start as part of the Strategic and Economic Dialogue, an annual meeting of Chinese and American officials on a broad range of issues. But a new working group is being organized on the subject that will meet more frequently, officials say.   Where the talks will lead, however, is unclear: after considerable debate within the Obama administration, officials have concluded that online conflict does not lend itself to the kind of arms control treaties that the United States and the Soviet Union began negotiating 50 years ago. Today, cyberweapons are held by private individuals as well as states, and figuring out where an attack began can be maddeningly difficult.   Another problem, China experts said, is that neither the Americans nor the Chinese are well prepared for a candid discussion of cyberissues. The growth of hacking, and its use in both military and corporate espionage, is a new enough phenomenon that it is not clear how seriously Mr. Xi and other senior Chinese leaders view it.   Tung Chee-hwa, a former chief executive of Hong Kong who has close ties to China&rsquo;s leaders, said recently that when he raises the American concerns about hacking with senior officials in Beijing, they express puzzlement.   And neither side, experts said, is ready to discuss military espionage, which means the conversation will necessarily focus on the theft of corporate secrets by China-based hackers. On that subject, they said, Mr. Obama needs to be unyielding.   &ldquo;Obama has got to say, &lsquo;You&rsquo;ve got a major hacking operation under way in Beijing, you&rsquo;ve got a major hacking operation under way in Shanghai. This is going to have repercussions if we don&rsquo;t see changes very quickly,&rsquo; &rdquo; said Kenneth G. Lieberthal, a China adviser in the Clinton administration who is now at the Brookings Institution.   China and the United States, experts say, could find common ground on the need to stop cyberattacks on critical national infrastructure, like the electrical grid, since it poses such a danger to both countries. &ldquo;I personally think a bilateral &lsquo;no sabotage&rsquo; pledge would be a very good idea,&rdquo; Mr. Bader said.\",\n      \"sentiment\": -2,\n      \"sentiment_reason\": \"Sentiment set to negative because the percentage of negative attributes are low and there are negative emotions.

&ldquo;casamento&rdquo; gay  Parlamento da Nigria aprova lei que criminaliza &ldquo;casamento&rdquo; gay Projeto torna crime o &ldquo;casamento homossexual&rdquo; e envolvimento em militncia de grupos homossexuais ABUJA, Nigria &mdash; A Cmara dos Deputados da Nigria aprovou nesta quinta-feira, 30, por unanimidade, uma lei que torna crime o &ldquo;casamento&rdquo; gay, relacionamentos erticos entre homens do mesmo sexo e o envolvimento direto com a militncia de grupos homossexuais. Evidentemente, essa lei viola diretamente a presso das potncias ocidentais, que exigem a garantia de direitos e privilgios para indivduos que praticam atos homossexuais. O projeto de lei, que contm penas de at 14 anos de priso, passou no Senado da Nigria no final de 2011, mas o presidente Goodluck Jonathan deve aprov-lo antes que se torne lei. Dois projetos de lei semelhantes foram propostos desde 2006, mas esta  a primeira vez que foi aprovado pela Assembleia Nacional. &ldquo;As pessoas que entram em um contrato de casamento do mesmo sexo ou unio civil cometem um crime e so passveis de condenao a uma pena de 14 anos de priso,&rdquo; diz o projeto de lei. &ldquo;Qualquer pessoa que se registre, opere ou participe em clubes gays, sociedades e organizaes ou faz, direta ou indiretamente, demonstrao pblica de relacionamento amoroso de mesmo sexo na Nigria comete um delito, devendo cada um ser passvel de condenao a uma pena de 10 anos de priso.&rdquo; A nova legislao certamente receber apoio popular, pois assim como em grande parte da frica subsaariana,  comum as pessoas na Nigria verem o homossexualismo como uma aberrao. Sob a atual lei federal nigeriana, a sodomia  punida com uma pena leve de priso, mas a lei aprovada caminha para uma pena mais pesada de priso. A Gr-Bretanha e outros pases ocidentais, que adotam a linha do imperialismo cultural pr-homossexualismo, esto usando toda a sua truculncia contra as populaes e governos que manifestarem apoio a esse tipo de projeto, ameaando cortar a ajuda internacional, inclusive assistncia para crianas. S recebero ajuda os pases que se submeterem s exigncias pr-homossexualismo do Ocidente. As presses e ameaas ocidentais tm contribudo para retardar ou inviabilizar a aprovao de legislaes em pases dependentes, como Uganda e Malaui, que queriam proteger suas sociedades e culturas da invaso da agenda gay ocidental em suas naes, mas no tiveram foras diante da truculncia e poderio financeiro e poltico de pases como EUA e Inglaterra.

You will survive Obama.\",\n      \"content\": \"The anti-argument against rape states women who dress scantily are asking for unwanted attention and advances and therefore should not dress that way to avoid such a situation.  Those who believe this are advocates of trading away liberty.  The premise of the argument is women should give away their freedom to express themselves by dressing anyway they see fit for the safety of possibly not luring a rapist to be overcome with attraction to attack them.

Numerous press reports are providing details of a massacre perpetrated by the Free Syrian Army that annihilated the entire population of a Christian village.  As the New York Times reported last December, anti-American sentiment has grown among the rebel organizations even as the American government has played a key role in propping up the rebellion. A crucial step in that support was the administration&rsquo;s decision to give formal recognition to rebel organizations &mdash; a step just short of recognizing them as the legitimate government of Syria. But now, those rebels Obama has vehemently supported are now proving that in Syria &mdash; as in Egypt several years ago &mdash; the rebels may prove worse than the tyrants they struggle to overthrow.  According to the Assyrian International News Agency (AINA), forces of the Free Syrian Army massacred the village on May 27: &ldquo;The armed rebels affiliated to the Free Syrian Army (FSA) raided the Christian-populated al-Duvair village in Reef (outskirts of) Homs near the border with Lebanon today and massacred all its civilian residents, including women and children. The Syrian army, however, intervened and killed tens of terrorists during heavy clashes which are still going on in al-Duvair village.&rdquo;  Although the United States had opposed the involvement of the al-Qaeda-affiliated Nusra Front in the rebel coalition, it did not express such reservations in December when Obama lavished his praise on the coalition. As the New York Times reported at that time:  But Mr. Obama praised the opposition, known formally as the National Coalition of Syrian Revolutionary and Opposition Forces, for what he said was its inclusiveness, its openness to various ethnic and religious groups, and its ties to local councils involved in the fighting against Mr. Assad&rsquo;s security forces.  &ldquo;At this point we have a well-organized-enough coalition &mdash; opposition coalition that is representative &mdash; that we can recognize them as the legitimate representative of Syrian people,&rdquo; he said.&hellip;   The United States has played an active role behind the scenes in shaping the opposition, insisting that it be broadened and made more inclusive. But until Mr. Obama&rsquo;s announcement, the United States had held off on formally recognizing the opposition, asserting that it wanted to use the lure of recognition to encourage the rebel leaders to flesh out their political structure and fill important posts.  Now Obama&rsquo;s inclusive opposition has allegedly slaughtered the entire population of al-Duvair, which is the type of crime that the U.S. president has previously purported was sufficient reason for the people of Syria to rise up and overthrow their government. And the massacre is hardly an isolated incident; for example, only several weeks ago, rebels attacked the St. Elijah Orthodoxy monastery. As Voice of Russia reported on May 12: &ldquo;The militants ransacked the cloister, destroyed the sanctuary, blew up the belfry and tore down the statue of St. Prophet Elijah who is equally revered in Syria by both Christians and Muslims, Syria&rsquo;s SANA news agency reports, quoting the head of the monastery, hegumen Gadir Ibrahim. The hegumen believes the attack to be the work of foreign mercenaries.&rdquo;  Reports of foreign mercenaries are nothing new in the war against the Assad regime, and the &ldquo;Syrian&rdquo; character of the rebellion has been in doubt for some time. As the Independent reported on December 20:  Fighters from as many as 29 countries have filtered into Syria to join a civil war that has split along sectarian lines, increasingly pitting the ruling Alawite community against the majority Sunni Muslims, UN human rights investigators said today.  The deepened sectarian divisions in Syria may diminish prospects for post-conflict reconciliation even if President Bashar al-Assad is toppled. And the influx of foreign fighters raises the risk of the war spilling into neighbouring countries.  &ldquo;As battles between government forces and anti-government armed groups approach the end of their second year, the conflict has become overtly sectarian in nature,&rdquo; the investigators led by Brazilian expert Paulo Pinheiro said in an updated report.&hellip;   Most of the foreign fighters slipping into Syria to join rebel groups, or fight alongside them, are Sunnis from other countries in the Middle East and North Africa, the UN investigators found. &ldquo;They come from all over, Europe and America, and especially the neighbouring countries,&rdquo; said Ms [Karen] Abuzayd.  Even as the American government has expanded its involvement in the war in Syria, the radicalization of the rebel forces has continued. While Syrian rebels perpetrate their own atrocities, Sen. John McCain (R-Ariz.) was still insisting &ldquo;We can identify who these people are. We can help the right people.&rdquo; As Reuters reported on May 29:  U.S. Senator John McCain said on Wednesday, two days after meeting with rebels in Syria, that he is confident the United States can send weapons to fighters in Syria without the risk they will fall into the wrong hands.  \\\"We can identify who these people are. We can help the right people,\\\" McCain said on CNN's program \\\"Anderson Cooper 360.\\\" &hellip;   Critics of some lawmakers' push to arm the rebels have expressed concerns that weapons could end up in the hands of militants who might eventually end up using them against the United States or its allies.  But McCain said such radical fighters make up only a small part of the rebels forces.  For example, he said, Syria's Islamist al-Nusra Front, identified as an alias of al Qaeda in Iraq, accounts for only about 7,000 of the 100,000 fighters battling the government of Assad.  \\\"Every single day, more and more extremists flow in.... \\\"They're flowing in all the time, these extremists. But they still do not make up a sizeable portion,\\\" the Arizona senator said.  When 7,000 members of an al-Qaeda front are acknowledged to be part of a US-backed coalition, one wonders how McCain and his allies are now defining &ldquo;small.&rdquo; And as McCain&rsquo;s and Obama&rsquo;s purported &ldquo;right people&rdquo; are busy massacring Christians &mdash; and others &mdash; in an &ldquo;overtly sectarian&rdquo; war conducted by foreign mercenaries and religious fanatics, the latest phase in the &ldquo;perpetual war for perpetual peace&rdquo; has moved on to the phase where its proponents will soon, once again, be \\\"shocked\\\" by the actions of their allies.

Place yourself in the shoes of a 29 year old graduate liberal arts student who did not inherit the gun-money-diamond power of Nicholas Oppenheimer, because there is only one Nick Oppenheimer who is fat, ugly and has a disproportionately large head.  You have also not produced a whole bunch of co-dependent children and are about to graduate with a post graduate degree and having already tucked under your belt some \\\"street experience\\\", and now left to complete one course about the concentration camps during WW II.  You run into me who is not being spoken about by the media, which I understand, and I then in the course of 30 seconds I take you to Ch.9 of The Diamond Invention book, how long before you tell all your university friends and family members that you like, that they need to listen up?  Notice that you are still breathing just like when you took your first breath.  When you inhale you feel less in control then when you breath out, and you know that you have less breaths ahead of you than when you started life.  Now let's assume that you are this 29 year old reading this, and you already know why it is that Sir Ernest Oppenheimer is not a name that was on the tip of your tongue before I began mentioning it and why it is if you have a need for money to start your business and/or destroy your competition you would go to one of Oppenheimer's companies where you will find the lowest cost loans because De Beers and their affiliates have a zero cost of capital.  How many of you who have had all this information for quite some time still manage to force yourselves to listen to what better known people than me are talking about when it comes to your money, or do you find that it is no struggle at all because you have convinced yourselves that if what I had to say was all that important then I would already be a household name and the first thing that would happen is that there would be an immediate suspension in the trading of shares of public corporations?  You know that if the Chairman of the US Federal Reserve has not already explained to you all why it is that Sir Ernest Oppenheimer was unknown to the masses and yet everyone has heard of J.D. Rockefeller, it is either because Mr. Bernanke and his predecessor, Alan Greenspan were either stupid or lying to you.  When you know that you have got the wrong information and yet you continue on like nothing has happened would you expect yourself to get more intelligent or dumber?  Does the feeling of stupid bring with it a happy or :( feeling?  Does it make sense to you that of all the people you know in the world that I would be the number one target of the people most profiting from keeping all of you in the dark, but for some reason, you are more angry with me than everyone else, other than yourself?  Do you find yourself liking your company as much as when you remember liking yourself the most?  If you were in my shoes would you be telling yourself that before I write my best selling book D-Money Lie I should wait until I am dead or would you be more focused on learning about the book publishing business even though there isn't anything about the book publishing business that you don't know?  Can anyone advise me on how I best get my information out and at the same time stay alive and enjoy life to the full?  Do you think it is wise that because I don't know whether tonight is going to be my last night that I should go out this evening and stuff myself like a pig and then wake up tomorrow morning hating myself to death and still I am breathing and knowing that there is no way to make up for being illogical in my choice of foods unless that meant in the process of being stupid I would attract someone more beautiful than my French-Canadian wife to sleep with?  When you are old and notice that you are not attractive to young people as you once were do you think your stupid thinking about food and what you drink has impacted your looks much the same way as your stupid thoughts?  Again, were you in my shoes, who out there would you be trying to impress?  When you look at fat people do you still think that they must be smart to have money otherwise why would anyone listen to someone who has trouble controlling their willpower unless they no longer have willpower?  If you are fat and don't know how the money is valued and why it is that the most unhealthiest foods are very inexpensive, that is very sad, but still that does not mean that those who are withholding the information from you were doing the right thing.  How do you compensate all the fat people who are fat because they were intentionally made ignorant not to ask the right questions?  Obama is not fat, so what is his excuse for making sure that Sir Ernest Oppenheimer remains an unknown to the masses?  Would you consider it evil if it turns out that Obama knows everything you all know about Sir Ernest Oppenheimer and his grandson Nicholas Oppenheimer?  If Barak Obama was not President of the United States of America and was just one of you reading this, would you say he was just as bad as you for not sharing the information?  Remember, all I am doing is trying to get people to start thinking because I know how difficult it is to acknowledge how stupid it feels to put up with people you helped get elected who you know cannot be trusted with either thinking smart or honestly and at some point your minds have to tell you that they are lying when not acknowledging the importance of the photo showing Putin in a very subservient position to someone who people like Obama should know as well as Putin.  This is all rather bizarre, don't you think?  You have never read a fiction novel or seen a horror movie close this.  Your minds also tell you that there is a number of people reading this which would convince you that everyone you know including Obama would understand all this as well as you, and that number we don't all have to agree on.  What provides you with comfort that nothing is going to change much if at all is your conviction that if it was going to happen it would have happened a long time ago, and besides all my information could easily be wiped out since it is mostly digital.  I also understand how very unimportant is the truth when it comes to making an honest living.  You have most likely not thought all that much about how hard the US Congress and President Obama work to make the money they make as they have to be constantly making speeches and that much more aware that their lies will inevitably catch up with them because their job description does not say they are allowed to lie unless it is in the interest of national security.  Sir Ernest Oppenheimer knew what he was doing when putting President Franklin D. Roosevelt and the US Congress on the spot, because he was quite certain, that despite not being an American citizen he was the most powerful person in the world only because he was smart enough to bribe the most powerful American politicians who put their personal interest ahead of the nation.  You would expect if you were Oppenheimer to bribe them with untraceable diamonds which didn't prevent Oppenheimer from also using highly paid prostitutes who wouldn't have all had tattooed on their tits the words, \\\"I am a prostitute\\\".  There was nothing funny about 6 million Jewish people murdered during the very brief Jewish Holocaust being first given a number that was tattooed on to their skin.  You would agree that is different than using one's free will to enter a tattoo parlor.  We have now moved on from logic to morals.  How would you judge the morals of Obama and the US Congress compared to your own?  Wouldn't you like your nightmares to end with Obama explaining his read of Edward Jay Epstein's The Diamond Invention book that was written in the same year that I emigrated from De Beers' South Africa to the United States of America and knowing when I landed at Chicago's O'Hare International Airport that so long as I kept my mouth shut and got through the mental gymnastic exercises I would soon be working for De Beers who decide what is marketed to their common herd?  Couldn't you see yourselves or even your dumbest next of kin being able to explain all this rather well unless they were so severely retarded that they couldn't feed themselves?  To think that not a single politician or academic or radio or TV talk show host has yet to question how corrupt was President Franklin D. Roosevelt when failing to at least have Sir Ernest Oppenheimer arrested for refusing his order and if that was not possible to have his Secretary of State instruct the CIA-OSS to assassinate Oppenheimer and at least save the lives of 6 million Jewish people?  7 decades of complete silence.  What do you think prompted his grandson Nicholas to present such a \\\"show of force\\\" on September 5, 2006?  Could it be that Nick O. was frightened by all your silence?  Put yourself in his shoes, would you be bothered that I would be so convincing that my mother Zena would warn me, \\\"ARE YOU NOT CONCERNED FOR YOUR LIFE!!\\\" and for the past going on 9 years my mother has lived as if I was already dead?  My mother and I didn't have a \\\"fallout\\\"; I just said that I believed the time was right to expose the Oppenheimers who never demonstrated that they meant us Jewish people well when providing Hitler with his diamonds and nor did De Beers explain what they did with the diamonds that Hitler did not use.  Even simpletons can read simple English.  You can all look back and see that Oppenheimer had no intention of complying with Roosevelt's Presidential Order otherwise he would have.  The United States Justice Department are also able to read and see that the negative consequences for the Oppenheimer family and their corporations throughout the world were not as devastating as they were to the 6 million horribly murdered.  You hear of \\\"slaps on the wrists\\\" that De Beers carefully orchestrate against themselves, but no war crimes tribunal has been convened, not even close.  It is hard to turn back the clock because it is impossible.  So people continue to function; that is normal.  What do you consider normal when the most abnormal situation took place that no one wants to talk about now, but still they cannot get enough of their History and nature channels.  When they were murdering the 6 million Jewish people and 40 million Russians and Chinese, there was more food available to the soldiers who survived.  That was very thoughtful of you.  Now I am speaking for all of you, and I have stopped that.  You see it does not matter how Sir Ernest Oppenheimer bribed Roosevelt and the US Congress because all that matters is that the lives of the 6 million Jewish people and the 40 million Russians and Chinese were not all that important.  Would you feel better or worse if Roosevelt and the US Congress were given a controlling interest in De Beers and their affiliates and then able to use the inheritance laws to pass them down to their offspring?  It looks like they committed mass murder as well as treason against the United States of America for pennies.  How much do you think would be a reasonable price for me to have to pay an editor?  How many of you would be willing to pay in advance for a first edition copy of my book?  What value do you think Nicholas Oppenheimer placed on getting Vladimir Putin to journey all the way to Johannesburg, South Africa on September 5, 2006 to have a photo of Putin looking hugely skeptical as Oppenheimer speaks, gesturing with his right hand?  Remember, neither Putin nor Oppenheimer have said that it is fake.  While lawyer President Obama never got explained when he was a law school student at Harvard Law School that price, including the price of the aircraft fuel to bring Putin to South Africa costs De Beers nothing as it is only resources that are consumed which brainwashed people don't understand but they think they are bright because someone unintelligent told them that they are and they got the math question right when asked how much 1 +1 equals, and they think because money has a number associated with it that the money is therefore as certain any number otherwise there would be more people arguing about the value of the money which they don't think is important because they prefer to argue about the things they are brainwashed to argue about such as whether Meryl Streep was putting on her best performance in her last movie, it does not mean that Putin was stupid when agreeing to come to South Africa as well as when he instructed the Kremlin to release that photo that speaks for itself 759 days later.  If your head pains too much and you are concerned about the side effects of a self performed frontal lobotomy because that is all you feel will lessen the pain, consider stopping reading.

These strikes were begun by President George W. Bush and have increased substantially under President Barack Obama.[4] Some media refer to the series of attacks as a \\\"drone war\\\".[5][6] Estimates of those killed in strikes between 2004 and early 2013 range from around 2000 to around 3000; estimates of the proportion of civilian deaths vary dramatically.The United States government has made hundreds of attacks on targets in northwest Pakistan since 2004 using drones (unmanned aerial vehicles) controlled by the American Central Intelligence Agency's Special Activities Division.[3] Most of these attacks are on targets in the Federally Administered Tribal Areas along the Afghan border in Northwest Pakistan. These strikes were begun by President George W. Bush and have increased substantially under President Barack Obama.[4] Some media refer to the series of attacks as a \\\"drone war\\\".[5][6]  Pakistan's government publicly condemns these attacks, but has secretly shared intelligence with the United States[7] and also allegedly allowed the drones to operate from Shamsi Airfield in Pakistan until 21 April 2011, when 150 Americans left the base.[8] According to secret diplomatic cables leaked by Wikileaks, Pakistan's Army Chief Ashfaq Parvez Kayani not only tacitly agreed to the drone flights, but in 2008 requested Americans to increase them.[9] However, Pakistan's Interior Minister Rehman Malik said, \\\"drone missiles cause collateral damage. A few militants are killed, but the majority of victims are innocent citizens.\\\"[10] The strikes are often linked to anti-American sentiment in Pakistan and the growing questionability of the scope and extent of CIA activities in Pakistan.  Reports of the number of militants versus civilian casualties differ.[11] According to the Pakistani authorities, 60 cross-border predator strikes in the period from January 2006 to April 2009 killed 14 wanted al-Qaeda leaders and 687 Pakistani civilians.[12][13] In a 2009 opinion article, Daniel L. Byman of the Brookings Institution wrote that drone strikes may have killed \\\"10 or so civilians\\\" for every \\\"mid- and high-ranking [al Qaeda and Taliban] leader.\\\"[14] In contrast, the New America Foundation has estimated that 80 percent of those killed in the attacks were militants.[15] The Pakistani military has stated that most of those killed were Al-Qaeda and Taliban militants.[16] The CIA believes that the strikes conducted since May 2010 have killed over 600 militants and have not caused any civilian fatalities, a claim that some experts disputed.[11] The Bureau of Investigative Journalism found that between 391 &ndash; 780 civilians were killed out of a total of between 1,658 and 2,597 and that 160 children are reported among the deaths. The Bureau also revealed that since President Obama took office at least 50 civilians were killed in follow-up strikes when they had gone to help victims and more than 20 civilians have also been attacked in deliberate strikes on funerals and mourners, tactics that have been condemned by legal experts.[17][18][19]  Barbara Elias-Sanborn has also claimed that, \\\"as much of the literature on drones suggests, such killings usually harden militants' determination to fight, stalling any potential negotiations and settlement.\\\"[20] However, analysis by the RAND Corporation suggests that \\\"drone strikes are associated with decreases in both the frequency and the lethality of militant attacks overall and in IED and suicide attacks specifically.\\\"[21]  A motive that the 2010 Times Square car bomber Faisal Shahzad stated was the repeated CIA drone attacks in Pakistan, his native country.[22]  Drone strikes were halted in November 2011 after NATO forces killed 24 Pakistani soldiers in the Salala incident.[23] Shamsi Airfield was evacuated of Americans and taken over by the Pakistanis December 2011.[24] The incident prompted an approximately two-month stop to the drone strikes, which resumed on 10 January 2012.  In March 2013, Ben Emmerson, the United Nations Special Rapporteur led a U.N. team that looked into civilian casualties from the U.S. drone attacks, and stated that the attacks are a violation of the sovereignty of Pakistan. Emmerson said government officials from the country clearly stated Pakistan does not agree to the drone attacks, which is contradicted by U.S. officials.[25]1) US Drone Strike Statistics estimate according to the New America Foundation.[26] (As of 17 April 2013) Year  Number of Attacks  Number Killed Min.

Russell George answers questions as the House Oversight Committee holds a hearing to investigate the extra scrutiny the Internal Revenue Service gave Tea Party and other conservative groups that applied for tax-exempt status, on Capitol Hill in Washington. Most of what Americans know about their government&rsquo;s crimes, misdeeds and foul-ups comes from the government itself. Washington&rsquo;s investigation machine never quits. Federal law calls for 73 inspectors general to watch over the work of Cabinet departments, agencies and commissions. About 14,000 auditors, analysts, lawyers and other staff, including armed criminal investigators, make up the IG force. (AP Photo/J. Scott Applewhite, File) WASHINGTON (AP) - Washington never stops investigating itself.  The probes that go public - what happened at the Internal Revenue Service, or in Benghazi, Libya, or with the seizure of journalists' phone and email records - are just a sampling. Thousands of federal workers spend hundreds of millions of dollars a year checking up on their peers. And Congress is watching, too.  Is this gotcha gallery trustworthy? Are investigators running amok, or toadying to the powers they're supposed to check? Or just treading water in a turbulent sea of some 2.1 million government workers? Opinions are as different as the thousand-and-one flavors of waste, fraud and abuse.  There are, however, ways to judge the quality of an investigation: how its leaders are chosen, how much independence they have, whether they have the resources and the authority they need and display the will to follow a question to its end.  A guide to Washington's scandal-hunting apparatus:  __  INSPECTORS GENERAL  They mostly do routine reviews that don't much interest the public or the media. But they also investigate things like:  -IRS targeting of tea party groups.  -The Justice Department's \\\"Fast and Furious\\\" gun-trafficking operation.  -An over-the-top Las Vegas conference that led to the resignation of the General Services Administration chief.  -NFL quarterback Michael Vick's dog-fighting ring.  Federal law calls for 73 inspectors general to watch over the work of Cabinet departments, agencies and commissions. They field a staff of about 14,000 auditors, analysts, lawyers and others, including armed criminal investigators. Their budgets total more than $2 billion, according to a 2011 report for Congress.  What do they do?  They investigate crimes such as fraud and bribery by federal workers, contractors and people who abuse the government's services. They call out mismanagement and wasteful spending and recommend better ways to do the public's business. They get tips from whistle-blowers and cases referred by Congress.  Who chooses the inspectors general?  The president nominates them for Cabinet departments and some other prominent agencies, with Senate confirmation. Others are appointed by the leaders of the agencies they investigate. By law, Congress gets 30 days' notice before an IG can be fired. Lawmakers complained that President Barack Obama didn't give notice or an adequate reason when he abruptly fired the AmeriCorps inspector general in 2009.  Pros: IGs report to Congress as well as their agency chief, and their independence is protected by law.  Cons: They are chosen by the administration they will investigate. A president can pick a weak investigator or leave a post unfilled. The State Department slot has been empty for five years, sparking complaints that an office run by a temporary fill-in is less powerful and autonomous.  Government expert Paul Light of New York University says the quality of inspectors general varies greatly. \\\"Some of them are very aggressive,\\\" he said, \\\"and some are very timid.\\\"  Even the hard-chargers tend to stay in the background. That leaves it to lawmakers or the media to spread the word about IG reports, which Light describes as \\\"mind-numbingly difficult to read\\\" and \\\"sleep inducing.\\\"  ___  SPECIAL COUNSELS  They're like superstar IGs.  Unleashing a special counsel automatically pushes a controversy to potential scandal level.  Under Justice Department rules, special counsels are called in to handle potential criminal cases that pose a conflict of interest for the department. They are appointed by the attorney general, who can turn to an outside lawyer or pluck someone from within the department.  The most famous special prosecutor probe: Watergate.  A recent example: Patrick Fitzgerald, then a U.S. attorney in Illinois, investigated George W. Bush administration officials in connection with the leak of covert CIA officer Valerie Plame's identity.  What about Kenneth Starr?  Starr wasn't a special counsel - he was a more powerful \\\"independent counsel\\\" appointed by a panel of three federal judges. Congress created that post after the shock of Watergate, when President Richard Nixon ordered the firing of special prosecutor Archibald Cox in what became known as the \\\"Saturday Night Massacre.\\\"  Congress allowed the independent counsel law to expire in 1999; the special counsel rules took its place.  Independent counsels had come to be seen as out-of-control. Democrats were embittered by the five-year, $70 million investigation, primarily run by Starr, that stretched from President Bill Clinton's Whitewater land deal through his affair with White House intern Monica Lewinsky and its cover-up.  Republicans felt burned by an earlier independent counsel, Lawrence Walsh, who spent six years and $47 million investigating the Reagan administration's secret Iran-Contra operations.  \\\"It was a great mistake to create a power to prosecute without any accountability,\\\" said Lanny Davis, an adviser in the Clinton White House who now specializes in managing political crises. \\\"You don't want the attorney general investigating himself. But you want accountability within the executive branch.\\\"  A special prosecutor, on the other hand, has wide latitude and can only be fired for \\\"good cause.\\\" That's unlikely - firing a special counsel would risk touching off a political storm. The attorney general also holds sway over a special counsel's budget and jurisdiction.  Sen. Lindsey Graham, R-S.C., and a few other Republicans have said a special prosecutor is needed to probe the IRS and the Justice Department's leaks investigations. Attorney General Eric Holder has shown no interest in appointing one.  ___  CONGRESS  No mystery here. If you've heard of a government probe, Congress probably had a hand in it. Lawmakers relish their oversight duties and promote their investigations. The big ones often merit creation of special or select committees and sometimes go on for years.  Some historic probes:  -Hearings on the 2008 financial crisis.  -Iran-Contra hearings.  -Church Committee probe of domestic spying and abuses by the CIA and FBI.  -Senate Watergate Committee.  In addition to the IRS, Benghazi and AP phone records, lawmakers lately have been looking into why Apple Inc. doesn't pay more U.S. taxes, sexual assaults within the military, and the Boston Marathon bombing.  Pros: As a constitutional check on the executive branch, lawmakers wield tremendous power to investigate what they please. They hire expert staff to do the legwork and subpoena witnesses to testify. They also command nearly 3,000 employees at the Government Accountability Office, which audits and analyzes government operations. A congressional hearing done right can rivet the nation's attention.  Cons: When investigations come across as politically motivated attacks, their influence is diminished. Likewise, lawmakers may go too easy on a president from their own party. It's easy to sling reckless charges, even at small fry who get swept into a hearing and besmirched.  ___  THE BLUE RIBBONS  The big ones helped Americans ease calamity into history. They include:  -9/11 Commission on the 2001 terrorist attacks.  -Rogers Commission on the Space Shuttle Challenger disaster.  -Warren Commission on the assassination of President John F. Kennedy.  -Roberts Commission on the Japanese attack on Pearl Harbor.  Lots of blue-ribbon-style commissions are flops, however, too weak or too partisan to command attention or created mostly for show.  Sometimes presidents attempt to head off a more damaging investigation by creating a quick and relatively sympathetic panel, such as Ronald Reagan's Tower Commission on the Iran-Contra scandal, said political scientist Kenneth Kitts, author of \\\"Presidential Commissions & National Security: The Politics of Damage Control.\\\"  \\\"You have to know who is picking these panel members,\\\" he said. \\\"In many cases, if you know who is serving, you can predict how they're going to come out on an issue.\\\"  And independent panels set up at lower levels of government, such as the State Department's commission on the Benghazi attacks, will carry less weight.  At their best, the panels assembled by a president or Congress, or both, are the ultimate investigations - nonpartisan, with the stature and authority to chase down the truth and inspire reform.  Sometimes they're messy. Light, who analyzed the impact of 100 national commissions for an upcoming book, points to the 1981 Greenspan Commission on saving Social Security as an example of success forged through bitter concessions and painful negotiation.  In the end, the type of investigation matters less than the people who carry it out.  \\\"What I tend to see in the ones that work is good leadership and political will,\\\" Light said, \\\"and just plain guts.\\\"  ___  Follow Connie Cass on Twitter: http://www.twitter.com/ConnieCass\",\n      \"sentiment\": -5,\n      \"sentiment_reason\": \"Sentiment set to -5 because the percentage of

As set forth in the indictment I asked a Citizens&rsquo; Grand Jury in Ocala, Fla., to issue on Oct. 29, 2012, Obama and Biden, boasting of their success in killing Osama bin Laden, publicly disclosed that Navy SEAL Team 6 special ops forces were responsible for bin Laden&rsquo;s assassination. This illegal disclosure &ndash; the likes of which never before having occurred with any administration &ndash; put a virtual target on the backs of SEAL Team 6 forces serving in the Afghan theater. Sure enough, just a few months later, on Aug. 6, 2011, a Chinook helicopter carrying 22 SEAL Team 6 members into battle was shot down by Taliban terrorist jihadists in obvious retaliation for the death of bin Laden. In effect, due to the release of the identity of SEAL Team 6, the deaths of these brave servicemen were the result of the crime of &ldquo;involuntary manslaughter&rdquo; by Obama and Biden. They were indicted for these crimes and will be tried in Ocala before a Citizens&rsquo; Court ironically after the July 4 holiday.\",\n      \"sentiment\": -4,\n      \"sentiment_reason\": \"Sentiment set to -4 because the percentage of negative attributes are high and there are negative emotions\",\n      \"feelings\": \"frustrated|1, \",\n      \"emotions\": \"shot|1, battle|1, sure|1, death|1, brave|1, involuntary|1, crime|1, likes|1, illegal|1, indictment|1, attack|1, thwart|1, grand|1, success|1, special|1, killing|1, vice|1, \",\n      \"posterms\": \"enough|1, sure|1, release|1, brave|1, will|1, result|1, responsible|1, special|1, bolster|1, security|1, leading|1, grand|1, success|1, highly|1, \",\n      \"negterms\": \"down|1, death|1, crime|1, involuntary|1, shot|1, battle|1, thwart|1, attack|1, indictment|1, illegal|1, vice|1, \",\n      \"image\": \"\",\n      \"id\": \"51aa025856ae0ecf2f000000\",\n      \"keywords\": \"seal,team,obama,citizens,months,ocala,2012,laden,these,before,biden,forces,president,administration,carrying,2011,helicopter,members,chinook,into,taliban,down,shot,battle,later,just,target,virtual,occurred,having,backs,serving,enough,sure,theater,afghan,terrorist,jihadists,crimes,will,indicted,manslaughter,involuntary,tried,court,holiday,july,after,ironically,crime,result,effect,death,retaliation,obvious,release,identity,servicemen,brave,klayman,deaths,suited,likes,nuclear,iranian,attack,israeli,facilities,branch,forth,elections,executive,leading,thwart,prospects,national,classified,highly,leaked,security,information,re-election,bidens,officials,bolster,indictment,asked,larry,special,political,navy,responsible,ladens,surrogates,disclosure,illegal,assassination,disclosed,publicly,vice,jury,grand,other,issue,boasting,purposes,osama,killing,success,never,\",\n      \"sitetype\": \"Social Network\"\n    },\n    \"sites\": \"www.facebook.com,www.nytimes.com,www.juliosevero.com,www.thenewamerican.com,friendfeed.com,www.canadafreepress.com,www.tpnn.com,politicalanimalblog.com,dailycaller.com,theblacksphere.net,www.bing.com,freakoutnation.com,maddowblog.msnbc.com,www.twitter.com,www.isthatbaloney.com\",\n    \"influencers\": \"deborah wessling|www.facebook.com,paulo pinto|www.juliosevero.com,we survived bush.  you will survive obama.|www.facebook.com,friendfeed|friendfeed.com,gary gevisser|www.facebook.com,justin dr&amp;eacute;w|www.facebook.com,abdullah rehman|www.facebook.com,y&amp;oslash;'boyfu ck's likea ratchetassbish|www.facebook.com,extortion 17 - demand a congressional hearing|politicalanimalblog.com,jeff poor|dailycaller.com,debi grecocanchola|theblacksphere.net,jim treacher|dailycaller.com,doug devillez|www.facebook.com\"\n  }\n}",

He was killed by Indian agency police on the Standing Rock Indian Reservation during an attempt to arrest him at a time when authorities feared that he would join the Ghost Dance movement.[3] Before the Battle of the Little Bighorn, Sitting Bull had a vision in which he saw the defeat of the 7th Cavalry under Lt. Col. George Armstrong Custer on June 25, 1876. Sitting Bull's leadership motivated his people to a major victory. Months after their victory at the battle, Sitting Bull and his group left the United States for Wood Mountain, Saskatchewan, where he remained until 1881, at which time he surrendered to U.S. forces. A small remnant of his band under Chief Wabl  decided to stay at Wood Mountain. After working as a performer, Sitting Bull returned to the Standing Rock Agency in South Dakota. Because of fears that he would use his influence to support the Ghost Dance movement, Indian Service agent James McLaughlin at Fort Yates ordered his arrest. During an ensuing struggle between Sitting Bull's followers and the agency police, Sitting Bull was shot in the side and head by Standing Rock policemen Lieutenant Bull Head (Tatankapah) and Red Tomahawk (Marcelus Chankpidutah) after the police were fired upon by Sitting Bull's supporters. His body was taken to nearby Fort Yates for burial, but in 1953, his remains were possibly exhumed and reburied near Mobridge, South Dakota, by his Lakota family, who wanted his body to be nearer to his birthplace.

Despite being embroiled in the American Civil War, the United States Army retaliated in 1863 and 1864, even against bands which had not been involved in the hostilities.[8] In 1864, two brigades of about 2200 soldiers under Brigadier General Alfred Sully attacked a village. The defenders were led by Sitting Bull, Gall and Inkpaduta.[8] The Sioux were driven out, but skirmishing continued into August.[citation needed] In September, Sitting Bull and about 100 Hunkpapa Sioux came across a small party near what is now Marmarth, North Dakota. They had been left behind by a wagon train commanded by Captain James L. Fisk to effect some repairs to an overturned wagon. When he led an attack, Sitting Bull was shot in the left hip by a soldier.[8] The bullet exited out through the small of his back, and the wound was not too serious.[9] Red Cloud's War[edit] Sitting Bull led numerous war parties against Fort Berthold, Fort Stevenson, and Fort Buford and their environs from 1865 through 1868.[10] Although Red Cloud was a leader of the Oglala Sioux, his leadership and attacks against forts in the Powder River Country of Montana were supported by Sitting Bull's guerrilla attacks on emigrant parties and smaller forts throughout the upper Missouri River region.[citation needed] By early 1868, the U.S. government desired a peaceful settlement to Red Cloud's War. It agreed to Red Cloud's demands that Forts Phil Kearny and C.F. Smith be abandoned. Chief Gall of the Hunkpapas (among other representatives of the Hunkpapas, Blackfeet, and Yankton Sioux) signed a form of the Treaty of Fort Laramie on July 2, 1868 at Fort Rice (near Bismarck, North Dakota).[11] Sitting Bull did not agree to the treaty. He continued his hit-and-run attacks on forts in the upper Missouri area throughout the late 1860s and early 1870s.[12] The events of 1868 mark a historically debated period of Sitting Bull's life. According to historian Stanley Vestal, who conducted interviews with surviving Hunkpapa in 1930, Sitting Bull was made \\\"Supreme Chief of the whole Sioux Nation\\\" at this time. Later historians and ethnologists have refuted this concept of authority, as the Lakota society was highly decentralised. Lakota bands and their elders made individual decisions.[13] The Great Sioux War of 1876[edit] For more details on this topic, see Great Sioux War of 1876.     Early Cabinet card of Sitting Bull, 1881.   Sitting Bull's band of Hunkpapa continued to attack migrating parties and forts in the late 1860s. When in 1871 the Northern Pacific Railway conducted a survey for a route across the northern plains directly through Hunkpapa lands, it encountered stiff Sioux resistance.[14] The same railway people returned the following year accompanied by federal troops. Sitting Bull and the Hunkpapa attacked the survey party, which was forced to turn back.[15] In 1873, the military accompaniment for the surveyors was increased again, but Sitting Bull's forces resisted the survey \\\"most vigorously.\\\"[16] The Panic of 1873 forced the Northern Pacific Railway's backers (such as Jay Cooke) into bankruptcy. This halted construction of the railroad through Sioux territory. After the discovery and new wealth from gold in California, other men became interested in the potential for gold mining in the Black Hills. In 1874, Lt. Col. George Armstrong Custer led a military expedition from Fort Abraham Lincoln near Bismarck, to explore the Black Hills for gold and to determine a suitable location for a military fort in the Hills.[17] Custer's announcement of gold in the Black Hills triggered the Black Hills Gold Rush. Tensions increased between the Sioux and European Americans' seeking to move into the Black Hills.[18] Although Sitting Bull did not attack Custer's expedition in 1874, the US government was increasingly pressured to open the Black Hills to mining and settlement. It was alarmed at reports of Sioux depredations (encouraged by Sitting Bull). In November 1875, the government ordered all Sioux bands outside the Great Sioux Reservation to move onto the reservation, knowing full well that not all would comply. As of February 1, 1876, the Interior Department certified as \\\"hostile\\\" those bands who continued to live off the reservation.[19] This certification allowed the military to pursue Sitting Bull and other Lakota bands as \\\"hostiles\\\". According to the historian Margot Liberty, many Lakota bands allied with the Cheyenne during the Plains Wars because they thought the other nation was under attack by the US. Given this connection, she suggests the major war should have been called \\\"The Great Cheyenne War\\\". Since 1860, the Northern Cheyenne had led several battles among the Plains Indians. Before 1876, the US Army had destroyed seven Cheyenne camps, more than those of any other nation.[20] However, other historians such as Robert M. Utley[21] and Jerome Greene[22][23] also use Lakota oral testimony as the basis for their conclusions that the Lakota coalition, of which Sitting Bull was the ostensible head, was the primary target of the federal government's pacification campaign. Battle of the Little Bighorn[edit] For more details on this topic, see Battle of the Little Bighorn.     Little Bighorn battlefield   During the period 18681876, Sitting Bull developed into the most important of Native American chiefs. After the Treaty of Fort Laramie (1868) and the creation of the Great Sioux Reservation, many traditional Sioux warriors, such as Red Cloud of the Oglala and Spotted Tail of the Brul, moved to reside permanently on the reservations. They were largely dependent for subsistence on the US Indian agencies. Many other chiefs, including members of Sitting Bull's Hunkpapa band such as Gall, at times lived temporarily at the agencies. They needed the supplies at a time when white encroachment and the depletion of buffalo herds reduced their resources and challenged Native American independence.[citation needed] In 1875, the Northern Cheyenne, Hunkpapa, Oglala, Sans Arc, and Minneconjou camped together for a Sun Dance, with both the Cheyenne medicine man White Bull or Ice and Sitting Bull in association. This ceremonial alliance preceded their fighting together in 1876.[20] Sitting Bull had a major revelation.  At the climactic moment, \\\"Sitting Bull intoned, 'The Great Spirit has given our enemies to us. We are to destroy them. We do not know who they are. They may be soldiers.' Ice too observed, 'No one then knew who the enemy were  of what tribe.'...They were soon to find out.\\\"(Utley 1992: 12224)  Sitting Bull's refusal to adopt any dependence on the white man meant that at times he and his small band of warriors lived isolated on the Plains. When Native Americans were threatened by the United States, numerous members from various Sioux bands and other tribes, such as the North Cheyenne, came to Sitting Bull's camp. His reputation for \\\"strong medicine\\\" developed as he continued to evade the European Americans.     Sketch of Sitting Bull; Harper's Weekly, December 8, 1877 issue.   After the January 1st ultimatum of 1876, when the US Army began to track down Sioux and others living off the reservation as hostiles, Native Americans gathered at Sitting Bull's camp. The chief took an active role in encouraging this \\\"unity camp\\\". He sent scouts to the reservations to recruit warriors, and told the Hunkpapa to share supplies with those Native Americans who joined them. An example of his generosity was Sitting Bull's taking care of Wooden Leg's Northern Cheyenne tribe. They had been impoverished by Captain Reynold's March 17, 1876 attack and fled to Sitting Bull's camp for safety.[20] The Hunkpapa chief provided resources to sustain the new recruits. Over the course of the first half of 1876, Sitting Bull's camp continually expanded, as natives joined him for safety in numbers. His leadership had attracted the warriors and families of an extensive village, estimated at more than 10,000 people. Lt. Col. Custer came across this large camp on June 25, 1876. Sitting Bull did not take a direct military role in the ensuing battle; instead he acted as a spiritual chief and had performed the Sun Dance, in which he fasted and sacrificed over 100 pieces of flesh from his arms, a week prior to the attack.[4] Custers 7th Cavalry advance party attacked Cheyenne and Lakota tribes at their camp on the Little Big Horn River (known as the Greasy Grass River to the Lakota) on June 25, 1876. The U.S. Army did not realize how large the camp was. More than 2,000 Native American warriors had left their reservations to follow Sitting Bull. Inspired by a vision of Sitting Bulls, in which he saw U.S. soldiers being killed as they entered the tribes camp, the Cheyenne and Lakota fought back. Custer's badly outnumbered troops lost ground quickly and were forced to retreat. The tribes led a counter-attack against the soldiers on a nearby ridge, ultimately annihilating them.[24] The Native Americans' victory celebrations were short-lived. Public shock and outrage at Custer's death and defeat, and the government's knowledge about the remaining Sioux, led them to assign thousands more soldiers to the area. Over the next year, the new American military forces pursued the Lakota, forcing many of the Native Americans to surrender. Sitting Bull refused to surrender and in May 1877 led his band across the border into Saskatchewan, Canada. He remained in exile for four years near Wood Mountain, refusing a pardon and the chance to return.[25] When crossing the border into Saskatchewan, Sitting Bull was met by the Canadian Mounties of the region. During this meeting, James Morrow Walsh, commander of the North-West Mounted Police, explained to Sitting Bull that the Lakota were now on British soil and must obey British law. Walsh emphasized that he enforced the law equally and that every person in the territory had a right to justice. Walsh became an advocate for Sitting Bull and the two became good friends for the remainder of their lives.[26] Also while in Canada Sitting Bull met with chief Crowfoot, who was a chief of the Blackfeet, long-time powerful enemies of the Lakota and Cheyenne. Sitting Bull wished to make peace with the Blackfeet Nation and Crowfoot. Being an advocate for peace himself, Crowfoot eagerly accepted the tobacco peace offering. Sitting Bull was so impressed by the Blackfeet chief that he named one of his sons after him.[27] Sitting Bull and his men only stayed in Canada for 4 years. Due to the smaller size of the buffalo herds in Canada, Sitting Bull and his men found it difficult to find enough food to feed his people, who were starving and exhausted. Furthermore, due to Sitting Bulls presence in the country, there had been a growth in tension between the Canadian and the United States governments.[28] Before Sitting Bull left Saskatchewan, he may have visited Walsh for a final time and left a ceremonial headdress as a memento.[29] Surrender[edit]     Fort Buford's original 1872 Commanding Officer's Quarters where Sitting Bull's surrender ceremony was held   Hunger and desperation eventually forced Sitting Bull, and 186 of his family and followers to return to the United States and surrender on July 19, 1881. Sitting Bull had his young son Crow Foot surrender his Winchester lever-action carbine to Major David H. Brotherton, commanding officer of Fort Buford in the parlor of the Commanding Officer's Quarters in a ceremony the next day. He told the 4 soldiers, 20 warriors and other guests in the small room, that he wished to regard the soldiers and the white race as friends but he wanted to know who would teach his son the new ways of the world. Two weeks later, after waiting in vain for other members of his tribe to follow him from Canada, the Army transferred Sitting Bull and his band to Fort Yates, the military post located adjacent to the Standing Rock Agency, which straddles the present-day boundary of North and South Dakota.[citation needed] Sitting Bull and his band of 186 people were kept separate from the other Hunkpapa gathered at the agency. Army officials were concerned that the famed chief would stir up trouble among the recently surrendered northern bands. On August 26, 1881, he was visited by the census taker William T. Selwyn, who counted twelve people in the Hunkpapa leader's immediate family. Forty-one families, totaling 195 people, were recorded in Sitting Bull's band.[30] The military decided to transfer him and his band to Fort Randall, to be held as prisoners of war. Loaded onto a steamboat, the band of 172 people was sent down the Missouri River to Fort Randall (near present-day Pickstown, South Dakota on the southern border of the state). There they spent the next 20 months. They were allowed to return north to the Standing Rock Agency in May 1883.[citation needed] Wild West Show participation[edit] In 1885, Sitting Bull was allowed to leave the reservation to go Wild Westing with Buffalo Bill Codys Buffalo Bill's Wild West. He got about $50 a week for riding once around the arena, where he was a popular attraction. Although it is rumored that he cursed his audiences in his native tongue during the show, the historian Utley contends that he did not.[31] Historians have reported that Sitting Bull gave speeches about his desire for education for the young, and reconciling relations between the Sioux and whites.[32] The historian Edward Lazarus wrote that Sitting Bull reportedly cursed his audience in Lakota in 1884, during an opening address celebrating the completion of the Northern Pacific Railway.[33] During his participation with the Wild West show, Sitting Bull met Annie Oakley. He was so impressed with Oakley's skills with firearms that he offered $65 for a photographer to take a photo of the two together.[34] The admiration and respect of was mutual. Oakley stated that Sitting Bull made a \\\"great pet\\\" of her.[35] Over time, Sitting Bull's respect for the young sharpshooter grew. Oakley was quite modest in her attire, deeply respectful of others and had a remarkable stage persona despite being a woman who stood only five feet in height. Sitting Bull felt that she was \\\"gifted\\\" by supernatural means in order to shoot so accurately with both hands. As a result of his esteem, he adopted her as a daughter in 1884. He named her \\\"Little Sure Shot\\\" -- a name that Oakley used throughout her career.[36] Sitting Bull stayed with the show for four months before returning home. During that time, audiences began to consider him a celebrity and a romanticized warrior. He earned a small fortune by charging for his autograph and picture, although he often gave his money away to the homeless and beggars.[37] Conversion[edit] In 1883, rumors floated that Sitting Bull had been baptized into the Catholic Church. James McLaughlin, Indian agent at Standing Rock Agency, dismissed these reports, saying that \\\"The reported baptism of Sitting-Bull is erroneous. There is no immediate prospect of such ceremony so far as I am aware.\\\" [38][39][40] Death and burial[edit]     \\\"Wild scene\\\", \\\"Squaws death chant heard in every direction\\\"       Monument at Sitting Bull's grave, Mobridge, South Dakota, 2003   Sitting Bull returned to the Standing Rock Agency after working in Buffalo Bill's Wild West Show. In 1890, James McLaughlin, the U.S. Indian Agent at Fort Yates on Standing Rock Agency, feared that the Lakota leader was about to flee the reservation with the Ghost Dancers, so he ordered the police to arrest him.[41] On December 14, 1890, McLaughlin drafted a letter to Lt. Henry Bullhead that included instructions and a plan to capture the chief. The plan called for the arrest to take place at dawn on December 15, and advised the use of a light spring wagon to facilitate the chief's removal before his followers could rally. Bullhead decided against using the wagon. He intended to have the police officers force Sitting Bull to mount a horse immediately after the arrest.[42] Around 5:30 a.m. on December 15, 39 police officers and four volunteers approached Sitting Bull's house. They surrounded the house, knocked and entered. Bullhead told Sitting Bull that he was under arrest and led him outside.[43] The camp awakened and men converged at the house of their chief. As Bullhead ordered Sitting Bull to mount a horse, he explained that the Indian Affairs agent needed to see him and then he could return to his house. Sitting Bull refused to comply and the police used force on him. The Sioux in the village were enraged. A Sioux known as Catch-the-Bear shouldered his rifle and shot Bullhead who, in return, fired his revolver into the chest of Sitting Bull.[44] Another police officer, Red Tomahawk, shot Sitting Bull in the head, and the chief dropped to the ground. He died between 12 and 1 p.m.[citation needed] A close-quarters fight erupted, and within minutes several men were dead. Six policemen were killed immediately and two more died shortly after the fight. Sitting Bull and seven of his supporters lay dead, along with two horses.[45] Sitting Bull's body was taken to Fort Yates to be placed in a coffin (made by the Army carpenter)[46] and for burial. In 1953 Lakota family members exhumed what they believed to be his remains, to be reinterred near Mobridge, South Dakota, his birthplace.[47][48] Legacy[edit]     Sitting Bull, 1882   Following Sitting Bull's death, his cabin on the Grand River was taken to Chicago to become an exhibit at the 1893 World's Columbian Exposition. Native American dancers also performed at the Exposition.[49] Sitting Bull was the subject of, or a featured character in, several Hollywood motion pictures and documentaries. Among them are:  Sitting Bull: The Hostile Sioux Indian Chief (1914) Sitting Bull at the Spirit Lake Massacre (1927) Annie Get Your Gun (1950) Sitting Bull (1954) Buffalo Bill and the Indians, or Sitting Bull's History Lesson (1976) Into the West (2005) Bury My Heart at Wounded Knee (2007) Sitting Bull: A Stone in My Heart (2008) Documentary [50]  As time passed, Sitting Bull became a symbol and archetype of Native American resistance movements as well as a figure celebrated by his former enemies:  On September 14, 1989, the United States Postal Service released a Great Americans series 28 postage stamp featuring a likeness of Sitting Bull.[51] On March 6, 1996, Standing Rock College was renamed Sitting Bull College in his honor. Sitting Bull College serves as an institution of higher education on Sitting Bull's home of Standing Rock in North Dakota and South Dakota. The American historian Gary Clayton Anderson of the University of Oklahoma published Sitting Bull and the Paradox of Lakota Nationhood a revisionist examination of the Lakota medicine man. Anderson stresses the Little Big Horn not so much as a mishap by Custer but in light of past succeses the Lakota Nation and the merits of Sitting Bull himself.[52] Legoland Billund, the first Legoland park, contains a Lego sculpture of Sitting Bull, the largest sculpture in the park. Sitting Bull is featured as the leader for the Native American Civilization in the computer game Civilization IV.[53] Sitting Bull is lionized as one of 13 great Americans in President Barack Obama's children's book, Of Thee I Sing: A Letter to My Daughters.[54] In August 2010, a research team led by Eske Willerslev, an ancient DNA expert at the University of Copenhagen, announced their intention to sequence the genome of Sitting Bull, with the approval of his descendents using a hair sample obtained during his lifetime.[55]  Gallery[edit]        Sitting Bull's grave at Fort Yates, ca. 1906          Sitting Bull and Buffalo Bill in 1885          Sitting Bull in Pierre, South Dakota on his way to Standing Rock Agency from Fort Randall          Sitting Bull (Tatonka-I-Yatanka), a Hunkpapa Sioux, 1885     See also[edit]  Black Elk Henry Mabb Catherine Weldon  Footnotes[edit]   ^ Encyclopdia Britannica 20. 1955. p.723. ^ New Lakota Dictionary, 2008 ^ Kehoe, Alice (2006).

Col. George Armstrong Custer on June 25, 1876. Sitting Bull's leadership motivated his people to a major victory. Months after their victory at the battle, Sitting Bull and his group left the United States for Wood Mountain, Saskatchewan, where he remained until 1881, at which time he surrendered to U.S. forces. A small remnant of his band under Chief Wabl  decided to stay at Wood Mountain. After working as a performer, Sitting Bull returned to the Standing Rock Agency in South Dakota. Because of fears that he would use his influence to support the Ghost Dance movement, Indian Service agent James McLaughlin at Fort Yates ordered his arrest. During an ensuing struggle between Sitting Bull's followers and the agency police, Sitting Bull was shot in the side and head by Standing Rock policemen Lieutenant Bull Head (Tatankapah) and Red Tomahawk (Marcelus Chankpidutah) after the police were fired upon by Sitting Bull's supporters. His body was taken to nearby Fort Yates for burial, but in 1953, his remains were possibly exhumed and reburied near Mobridge, South Dakota, by his Lakota family, who wanted his body to be nearer to his birthplace.

Despite being embroiled in the American Civil War, the United States Army retaliated in 1863 and 1864, even against bands which had not been involved in the hostilities.[8] In 1864, two brigades of about 2200 soldiers under Brigadier General Alfred Sully attacked a village. The defenders were led by Sitting Bull, Gall and Inkpaduta.[8] The Sioux were driven out, but skirmishing continued into August.[citation needed] In September, Sitting Bull and about 100 Hunkpapa Sioux came across a small party near what is now Marmarth, North Dakota. They had been left behind by a wagon train commanded by Captain James L. Fisk to effect some repairs to an overturned wagon. When he led an attack, Sitting Bull was shot in the left hip by a soldier.[8] The bullet exited out through the small of his back, and the wound was not too serious.[9] Red Cloud's War[edit] Sitting Bull led numerous war parties against Fort Berthold, Fort Stevenson, and Fort Buford and their environs from 1865 through 1868.[10] Although Red Cloud was a leader of the Oglala Sioux, his leadership and attacks against forts in the Powder River Country of Montana were supported by Sitting Bull's guerrilla attacks on emigrant parties and smaller forts throughout the upper Missouri River region.[citation needed] By early 1868, the U.S. government desired a peaceful settlement to Red Cloud's War. It agreed to Red Cloud's demands that Forts Phil Kearny and C.F. Smith be abandoned. Chief Gall of the Hunkpapas (among other representatives of the Hunkpapas, Blackfeet, and Yankton Sioux) signed a form of the Treaty of Fort Laramie on July 2, 1868 at Fort Rice (near Bismarck, North Dakota).[11] Sitting Bull did not agree to the treaty. He continued his hit-and-run attacks on forts in the upper Missouri area throughout the late 1860s and early 1870s.[12] The events of 1868 mark a historically debated period of Sitting Bull's life. According to historian Stanley Vestal, who conducted interviews with surviving Hunkpapa in 1930, Sitting Bull was made \\\"Supreme Chief of the whole Sioux Nation\\\" at this time. Later historians and ethnologists have refuted this concept of authority, as the Lakota society was highly decentralised. Lakota bands and their elders made individual decisions.[13] The Great Sioux War of 1876[edit] For more details on this topic, see Great Sioux War of 1876.     Early Cabinet card of Sitting Bull, 1881.   Sitting Bull's band of Hunkpapa continued to attack migrating parties and forts in the late 1860s. When in 1871 the Northern Pacific Railway conducted a survey for a route across the northern plains directly through Hunkpapa lands, it encountered stiff Sioux resistance.[14] The same railway people returned the following year accompanied by federal troops. Sitting Bull and the Hunkpapa attacked the survey party, which was forced to turn back.[15] In 1873, the military accompaniment for the surveyors was increased again, but Sitting Bull's forces resisted the survey \\\"most vigorously.\\\"[16] The Panic of 1873 forced the Northern Pacific Railway's backers (such as Jay Cooke) into bankruptcy. This halted construction of the railroad through Sioux territory. After the discovery and new wealth from gold in California, other men became interested in the potential for gold mining in the Black Hills. In 1874, Lt. Col. George Armstrong Custer led a military expedition from Fort Abraham Lincoln near Bismarck, to explore the Black Hills for gold and to determine a suitable location for a military fort in the Hills.[17] Custer's announcement of gold in the Black Hills triggered the Black Hills Gold Rush. Tensions increased between the Sioux and European Americans' seeking to move into the Black Hills.[18] Although Sitting Bull did not attack Custer's expedition in 1874, the US government was increasingly pressured to open the Black Hills to mining and settlement. It was alarmed at reports of Sioux depredations (encouraged by Sitting Bull). In November 1875, the government ordered all Sioux bands outside the Great Sioux Reservation to move onto the reservation, knowing full well that not all would comply. As of February 1, 1876, the Interior Department certified as \\\"hostile\\\" those bands who continued to live off the reservation.[19] This certification allowed the military to pursue Sitting Bull and other Lakota bands as \\\"hostiles\\\". According to the historian Margot Liberty, many Lakota bands allied with the Cheyenne during the Plains Wars because they thought the other nation was under attack by the US. Given this connection, she suggests the major war should have been called \\\"The Great Cheyenne War\\\". Since 1860, the Northern Cheyenne had led several battles among the Plains Indians. Before 1876, the US Army had destroyed seven Cheyenne camps, more than those of any other nation.[20] However, other historians such as Robert M. Utley[21] and Jerome Greene[22][23] also use Lakota oral testimony as the basis for their conclusions that the Lakota coalition, of which Sitting Bull was the ostensible head, was the primary target of the federal government's pacification campaign. Battle of the Little Bighorn[edit] For more details on this topic, see Battle of the Little Bighorn.     Little Bighorn battlefield   During the period 18681876, Sitting Bull developed into the most important of Native American chiefs. After the Treaty of Fort Laramie (1868) and the creation of the Great Sioux Reservation, many traditional Sioux warriors, such as Red Cloud of the Oglala and Spotted Tail of the Brul, moved to reside permanently on the reservations. They were largely dependent for subsistence on the US Indian agencies. Many other chiefs, including members of Sitting Bull's Hunkpapa band such as Gall, at times lived temporarily at the agencies. They needed the supplies at a time when white encroachment and the depletion of buffalo herds reduced their resources and challenged Native American independence.[citation needed] In 1875, the Northern Cheyenne, Hunkpapa, Oglala, Sans Arc, and Minneconjou camped together for a Sun Dance, with both the Cheyenne medicine man White Bull or Ice and Sitting Bull in association. This ceremonial alliance preceded their fighting together in 1876.[20] Sitting Bull had a major revelation.  At the climactic moment, \\\"Sitting Bull intoned, 'The Great Spirit has given our enemies to us. We are to destroy them. We do not know who they are. They may be soldiers.' Ice too observed, 'No one then knew who the enemy were  of what tribe.'...They were soon to find out.\\\"(Utley 1992: 12224)  Sitting Bull's refusal to adopt any dependence on the white man meant that at times he and his small band of warriors lived isolated on the Plains. When Native Americans were threatened by the United States, numerous members from various Sioux bands and other tribes, such as the North Cheyenne, came to Sitting Bull's camp. His reputation for \\\"strong medicine\\\" developed as he continued to evade the European Americans.     Sketch of Sitting Bull; Harper's Weekly, December 8, 1877 issue.   After the January 1st ultimatum of 1876, when the US Army began to track down Sioux and others living off the reservation as hostiles, Native Americans gathered at Sitting Bull's camp. The chief took an active role in encouraging this \\\"unity camp\\\". He sent scouts to the reservations to recruit warriors, and told the Hunkpapa to share supplies with those Native Americans who joined them. An example of his generosity was Sitting Bull's taking care of Wooden Leg's Northern Cheyenne tribe. They had been impoverished by Captain Reynold's March 17, 1876 attack and fled to Sitting Bull's camp for safety.[20] The Hunkpapa chief provided resources to sustain the new recruits. Over the course of the first half of 1876, Sitting Bull's camp continually expanded, as natives joined him for safety in numbers. His leadership had attracted the warriors and families of an extensive village, estimated at more than 10,000 people. Lt. Col. Custer came across this large camp on June 25, 1876. Sitting Bull did not take a direct military role in the ensuing battle; instead he acted as a spiritual chief and had performed the Sun Dance, in which he fasted and sacrificed over 100 pieces of flesh from his arms, a week prior to the attack.[4] Custers 7th Cavalry advance party attacked Cheyenne and Lakota tribes at their camp on the Little Big Horn River (known as the Greasy Grass River to the Lakota) on June 25, 1876. The U.S. Army did not realize how large the camp was. More than 2,000 Native American warriors had left their reservations to follow Sitting Bull. Inspired by a vision of Sitting Bulls, in which he saw U.S. soldiers being killed as they entered the tribes camp, the Cheyenne and Lakota fought back. Custer's badly outnumbered troops lost ground quickly and were forced to retreat. The tribes led a counter-attack against the soldiers on a nearby ridge, ultimately annihilating them.[24] The Native Americans' victory celebrations were short-lived. Public shock and outrage at Custer's death and defeat, and the government's knowledge about the remaining Sioux, led them to assign thousands more soldiers to the area. Over the next year, the new American military forces pursued the Lakota, forcing many of the Native Americans to surrender. Sitting Bull refused to surrender and in May 1877 led his band across the border into Saskatchewan, Canada. He remained in exile for four years near Wood Mountain, refusing a pardon and the chance to return.[25] When crossing the border into Saskatchewan, Sitting Bull was met by the Canadian Mounties of the region. During this meeting, James Morrow Walsh, commander of the North-West Mounted Police, explained to Sitting Bull that the Lakota were now on British soil and must obey British law. Walsh emphasized that he enforced the law equally and that every person in the territory had a right to justice. Walsh became an advocate for Sitting Bull and the two became good friends for the remainder of their lives.[26] Also while in Canada Sitting Bull met with chief Crowfoot, who was a chief of the Blackfeet, long-time powerful enemies of the Lakota and Cheyenne. Sitting Bull wished to make peace with the Blackfeet Nation and Crowfoot. Being an advocate for peace himself, Crowfoot eagerly accepted the tobacco peace offering. Sitting Bull was so impressed by the Blackfeet chief that he named one of his sons after him.[27] Sitting Bull and his men only stayed in Canada for 4 years. Due to the smaller size of the buffalo herds in Canada, Sitting Bull and his men found it difficult to find enough food to feed his people, who were starving and exhausted. Furthermore, due to Sitting Bulls presence in the country, there had been a growth in tension between the Canadian and the United States governments.[28] Before Sitting Bull left Saskatchewan, he may have visited Walsh for a final time and left a ceremonial headdress as a memento.[29] Surrender[edit]     Fort Buford's original 1872 Commanding Officer's Quarters where Sitting Bull's surrender ceremony was held   Hunger and desperation eventually forced Sitting Bull, and 186 of his family and followers to return to the United States and surrender on July 19, 1881. Sitting Bull had his young son Crow Foot surrender his Winchester lever-action carbine to Major David H. Brotherton, commanding officer of Fort Buford in the parlor of the Commanding Officer's Quarters in a ceremony the next day. He told the 4 soldiers, 20 warriors and other guests in the small room, that he wished to regard the soldiers and the white race as friends but he wanted to know who would teach his son the new ways of the world. Two weeks later, after waiting in vain for other members of his tribe to follow him from Canada, the Army transferred Sitting Bull and his band to Fort Yates, the military post located adjacent to the Standing Rock Agency, which straddles the present-day boundary of North and South Dakota.[citation needed] Sitting Bull and his band of 186 people were kept separate from the other Hunkpapa gathered at the agency. Army officials were concerned that the famed chief would stir up trouble among the recently surrendered northern bands. On August 26, 1881, he was visited by the census taker William T. Selwyn, who counted twelve people in the Hunkpapa leader's immediate family. Forty-one families, totaling 195 people, were recorded in Sitting Bull's band.[30] The military decided to transfer him and his band to Fort Randall, to be held as prisoners of war. Loaded onto a steamboat, the band of 172 people was sent down the Missouri River to Fort Randall (near present-day Pickstown, South Dakota on the southern border of the state). There they spent the next 20 months. They were allowed to return north to the Standing Rock Agency in May 1883.[citation needed] Wild West Show participation[edit] In 1885, Sitting Bull was allowed to leave the reservation to go Wild Westing with Buffalo Bill Codys Buffalo Bill's Wild West. He got about $50 a week for riding once around the arena, where he was a popular attraction. Although it is rumored that he cursed his audiences in his native tongue during the show, the historian Utley contends that he did not.[31] Historians have reported that Sitting Bull gave speeches about his desire for education for the young, and reconciling relations between the Sioux and whites.[32] The historian Edward Lazarus wrote that Sitting Bull reportedly cursed his audience in Lakota in 1884, during an opening address celebrating the completion of the Northern Pacific Railway.[33] During his participation with the Wild West show, Sitting Bull met Annie Oakley. He was so impressed with Oakley's skills with firearms that he offered $65 for a photographer to take a photo of the two together.[34] The admiration and respect of was mutual. Oakley stated that Sitting Bull made a \\\"great pet\\\" of her.[35] Over time, Sitting Bull's respect for the young sharpshooter grew. Oakley was quite modest in her attire, deeply respectful of others and had a remarkable stage persona despite being a woman who stood only five feet in height. Sitting Bull felt that she was \\\"gifted\\\" by supernatural means in order to shoot so accurately with both hands. As a result of his esteem, he adopted her as a daughter in 1884. He named her \\\"Little Sure Shot\\\" -- a name that Oakley used throughout her career.[36] Sitting Bull stayed with the show for four months before returning home. During that time, audiences began to consider him a celebrity and a romanticized warrior. He earned a small fortune by charging for his autograph and picture, although he often gave his money away to the homeless and beggars.[37] Conversion[edit] In 1883, rumors floated that Sitting Bull had been baptized into the Catholic Church. James McLaughlin, Indian agent at Standing Rock Agency, dismissed these reports, saying that \\\"The reported baptism of Sitting-Bull is erroneous. There is no immediate prospect of such ceremony so far as I am aware.\\\" [38][39][40] Death and burial[edit]     \\\"Wild scene\\\", \\\"Squaws death chant heard in every direction\\\"       Monument at Sitting Bull's grave, Mobridge, South Dakota, 2003   Sitting Bull returned to the Standing Rock Agency after working in Buffalo Bill's Wild West Show. In 1890, James McLaughlin, the U.S. Indian Agent at Fort Yates on Standing Rock Agency, feared that the Lakota leader was about to flee the reservation with the Ghost Dancers, so he ordered the police to arrest him.[41] On December 14, 1890, McLaughlin drafted a letter to Lt. Henry Bullhead that included instructions and a plan to capture the chief. The plan called for the arrest to take place at dawn on December 15, and advised the use of a light spring wagon to facilitate the chief's removal before his followers could rally. Bullhead decided against using the wagon. He intended to have the police officers force Sitting Bull to mount a horse immediately after the arrest.[42] Around 5:30 a.m. on December 15, 39 police officers and four volunteers approached Sitting Bull's house. They surrounded the house, knocked and entered. Bullhead told Sitting Bull that he was under arrest and led him outside.[43] The camp awakened and men converged at the house of their chief. As Bullhead ordered Sitting Bull to mount a horse, he explained that the Indian Affairs agent needed to see him and then he could return to his house. Sitting Bull refused to comply and the police used force on him. The Sioux in the village were enraged. A Sioux known as Catch-the-Bear shouldered his rifle and shot Bullhead who, in return, fired his revolver into the chest of Sitting Bull.[44] Another police officer, Red Tomahawk, shot Sitting Bull in the head, and the chief dropped to the ground. He died between 12 and 1 p.m.[citation needed] A close-quarters fight erupted, and within minutes several men were dead. Six policemen were killed immediately and two more died shortly after the fight. Sitting Bull and seven of his supporters lay dead, along with two horses.[45] Sitting Bull's body was taken to Fort Yates to be placed in a coffin (made by the Army carpenter)[46] and for burial. In 1953 Lakota family members exhumed what they believed to be his remains, to be reinterred near Mobridge, South Dakota, his birthplace.[47][48] Legacy[edit]     Sitting Bull, 1882   Following Sitting Bull's death, his cabin on the Grand River was taken to Chicago to become an exhibit at the 1893 World's Columbian Exposition. Native American dancers also performed at the Exposition.[49] Sitting Bull was the subject of, or a featured character in, several Hollywood motion pictures and documentaries. Among them are:  Sitting Bull: The Hostile Sioux Indian Chief (1914) Sitting Bull at the Spirit Lake Massacre (1927) Annie Get Your Gun (1950) Sitting Bull (1954) Buffalo Bill and the Indians, or Sitting Bull's History Lesson (1976) Into the West (2005) Bury My Heart at Wounded Knee (2007) Sitting Bull: A Stone in My Heart (2008) Documentary [50]  As time passed, Sitting Bull became a symbol and archetype of Native American resistance movements as well as a figure celebrated by his former enemies:  On September 14, 1989, the United States Postal Service released a Great Americans series 28 postage stamp featuring a likeness of Sitting Bull.[51] On March 6, 1996, Standing Rock College was renamed Sitting Bull College in his honor. Sitting Bull College serves as an institution of higher education on Sitting Bull's home of Standing Rock in North Dakota and South Dakota. The American historian Gary Clayton Anderson of the University of Oklahoma published Sitting Bull and the Paradox of Lakota Nationhood a revisionist examination of the Lakota medicine man. Anderson stresses the Little Big Horn not so much as a mishap by Custer but in light of past succeses the Lakota Nation and the merits of Sitting Bull himself.[52] Legoland Billund, the first Legoland park, contains a Lego sculpture of Sitting Bull, the largest sculpture in the park. Sitting Bull is featured as the leader for the Native American Civilization in the computer game Civilization IV.[53] Sitting Bull is lionized as one of 13 great Americans in President Barack Obama's children's book, Of Thee I Sing: A Letter to My Daughters.[54] In August 2010, a research team led by Eske Willerslev, an ancient DNA expert at the University of Copenhagen, announced their intention to sequence the genome of Sitting Bull, with the approval of his descendents using a hair sample obtained during his lifetime.[55]  Gallery[edit]        Sitting Bull's grave at Fort Yates, ca. 1906          Sitting Bull and Buffalo Bill in 1885          Sitting Bull in Pierre, South Dakota on his way to Standing Rock Agency from Fort Randall          Sitting Bull (Tatonka-I-Yatanka), a Hunkpapa Sioux, 1885     See also[edit]  Black Elk Henry Mabb Catherine Weldon  Footnotes[edit]   ^ Encyclopdia Britannica 20. 1955. p.723. ^ New Lakota Dictionary, 2008 ^ Kehoe, Alice (2006).

With the aid of an old mystic named Vitruvius (Morgan Freeman), a tough young lady named Wyldstyle (Elizabeth Banks),[5] and Batman (Will Arnett), Emmet will fight to defeat the evil tyrant Lord Business (Will Ferrell) who is bent on destroying the Lego universe by gluing it together.[6] Cast[edit]  Chris Pratt as Emmet[6] Will Arnett as Batman[6] Elizabeth Banks as Wyldstyle[6][5] Morgan Freeman as Vitruvius[6] Will Ferrell as President Business/Lord Business[7][5] Liam Neeson as Bad Cop/Good Cop[7][5] Nick Offerman as Metal Beard[7] Jonah Hill as Green Lantern[8] Cobie Smulders as Wonder Woman[8] Channing Tatum as Superman[8] Charlie Day as Spaceman Benny[5] Alison Brie as Uni-Kitty[7][9]  Production[edit]               Creators of the film at the 2013 San Diego Comic-Con International: Phil Lord and Chris Miller, writers and directors; Chris McKay, co-director; and Dan Lin, producer.   The film has been in development at Warner Bros. since 2008.[10] In August 2009, it was announced that Dan and Kevin Hageman were writing the script for a comedy action adventure live-action/animated film.[11] Cloudy with a Chance of Meatballs directors Phil Lord and Chris Miller were hired in June 2010, to write and direct the film.[12] In November 2011, it was reported that Warner Bros. had green-lit the film, with a schedule to release it in 2014. Australian Animal Logic will provide the animation, which is expected to comprise 80% of the film. Chris McKay, the director of Robot Chicken, has also joined Lord and Miller to co-direct the film.[10] In March 2012, Lord and Miller revealed its working title, Lego: The Piece of Resistance, and a storyline: \\\"It involves many worlds. Basically, the least qualified Lego characters in the universe having to keep the world from being frozen together.\\\"[13] In April 2012, Warner Bros. scheduled the film for February 28, 2014.[14] The first cast was reported in June 2012, with Chris Pratt voicing Emmet, the lead Lego character, and Will Arnett voicing Lego Batman; while the role of Lego Superman has been offered to Channing Tatum.[15] In August 2012, it was revealed that Elizabeth Banks will voice \\\"tough-as-nails\\\" Lucy (later renamed Wyldstyle)[5] and Morgan Freeman will lend his voice to Vitruvius, an old mystic.[16] The film will tell a story of Emmet, an ordinary, law-abiding, Lego minifigure, who is mistaken for the most extraordinary Master Builder. He is drafted into a fellowship of strangers including Vitruvius, Wyldstyle and Batman, on a quest to stop an evil tyrant from gluing the universe together.[15][16] In October 2012, Warner Bros. shifted the release date for the film, simply titled Lego, to February 7, 2014.[17] On November 2012, Alison Brie, Will Ferrell, Liam Neeson and Nick Offerman have signed on for roles. Brie will voice a member of Emmet's team with a powerful secret, Ferrell will play a villain named President Business, Neeson will play a foe called Bad Cop, and Offerman will play Metal Beard,[18] a pirate seeking revenge on the President.[19] On March 21, 2013, it was announced the name of the movie would be \\\"The Lego Movie\\\".[20] Since July 2012, a contest has been running on the official Facebook page, which will enable the winning Lego vehicle to appear in the film.[21] 17 Lego building sets based on the film's scenes and characters will be released,[22] including Lord Business' Evil Lair,[23] and Cloud Cuckoo Palace,[9] along with a new set of 16 Minifigures (William Shakespeare, Gail the Construction Worker, Panda Guy, Abraham Lincoln, Taco Tuesday Guy, Larry the Barista, President Business, Calamity Drone, Marsha Queen of the Mermaids, Wild West Wyldstyle, Scribbe-Face Bad Cop, Velma Staplebot, Hard Hat Emmet, \\\"Where are my Pants?\\\" Guy, Mrs. Scratchen-Post and Wiley Fusebot).[24][22] Miller's personal Lego set from his childhood, Space Village, will be utilized in the film.[25] Release[edit] The Lego Movie is scheduled to be released on February 7, 2014.

(July 2012)              Re-enactment of the crucifixion   The Holy Land Experience (HLE) is a Christian theme park in Orlando, Florida and registered non-profit corporation. HLE conducts weekly church services and bible studies for the general public. HLEs theme park recreates the architecture and themes of the ancient city of Jerusalem in 1st century Israel. The Holy Land Experience is owned by the Trinity Broadcasting Network. Jan Crouch is Director and CEO.

Ivanov founded both the Holy Land Experience and Zion's Hope, which funded the park's initial construction. The park opened in February 2001. The Jewish Defense League protested at the Holy Land Experience on its opening day; the group claimed that the purpose of the park was to convert Jews to Christianity, although Ivanov denied these claims.[2] The Scriptorium: Center for Biblical Antiquities[edit] On August 17, 2002, the Holy Land Experience Scriptorium museum opened. It features the Van Kampen Collection of biblically related artifacts. The collection includes ancient scrolls, manuscripts, and early printed editions of the Bible. The collection is the fourth largest of its kind. The Van Kampen Collection was founded in 1986 by Robert and Judith Van Kampen. In 1994 Robert Van Kampen established a privately funded research library for the purpose of presenting the collection to the academic community as well as the general public. The Scriptorium: Center for Christian Antiquities, located in Grand Haven, MI, housed the Collection. In 2002, the Collection relocated to Orlando, where it is on loan to the Holy Land Experience.[3] Trinity Broadcasting Network ownership[edit] Main article: Trinity Broadcasting Network In June 2007, the Holy Land Experience Board of Directors sold the property to the Trinity Broadcasting Network (TBN), for an estimated $37 million. The property was an estimated $8 million in debt at the time of the sale.[4] A that time TBN planned to update the park and use the property to build a Central Florida broadcasting facility, and a movie studio in order to produce Christian films. On August 21, 2007, former president and board member, Tom Powell, resigned his position to seek \\\"new challenges.\\\" Four people remained on the park's board: Paul Crouch Sr., Jan Crouch, Paul Crouch Jr., and Matthew Crouch.[5] Between 50 and 100 employees lost their jobs when they were cut from the payroll in October 2007.[4] Under TBNs ownership, The Holy Land Experience underwent construction and the addition of new landscaping, exhibits, restaurants, and theaters which feature live musical and theatrical productions.[6] The park has also introduced weekly bible studies, church services and live cooking demonstrations. The Smile of a Child Adventure Land was added to the park exhibits. This childrens park features exhibits and activities for children, such as a wilderness rock-climbing wall, toy store, childrens theater and craft center. Holy Land Experience mission statement[edit] HLE is a non-denominational Christian theme park and church. Church services and bible studies are conducted by ordained pastors for the general public on a weekly basis. HLE is registered as a non-profit corporation with the Florida Department of State Division of Corporations.[7] Church of All Nations[edit] In 2012, the 2,000 seat Church of All Nations auditorium opened. The facility features live presentations and reenactments of the passion and crucifixion of Jesus Christ, and the depiction of the resurrection and ascension of Jesus Christ to heaven. Live taping of TBNs flagship TV show, Praise the Lord, are also taped in this facility, in addition to concerts and church services. Exhibits[edit] There are approximately 40 exhibits in the park, including several restaurants and retail shops.[8][9]  Main entrance/City Gate: A stone arch modeled after the Damascus Gate and Jaffa Gate of Jerusalem.   Jerusalem Street Market: A Middle Eastern marketplace, with city well, and street merchants who interact with guests.   The Old Scroll Shop: An example of 1st century shopping.   Wilderness Tabernacle: A High Priest describes Israels ancient priesthood, culminating with the Ark of the Covenant.

Tax status[edit] There was a four-year legal fight concerning almost $1,000,000 in property taxes that Orange County Property Appraiser Bill Donegan alleged were owed. Donnegan argued that the Holy Land Experience is a theme park. Donegan dropped his fight after state lawmakers passed a law in 2006 granting a tax exemption for theme parks that display, exhibit, illustrate and interpret biblical manuscripts. This is similar to the tax exemption for museums that present historical information on other subjects. The law prevented Orange County from collecting the alleged back taxes as well as forgiving the park $300,000 in yearly property taxes. The law requires the park to offer an annual free admissions day.[10][11] See also[edit]  Holy Land USA, a similar park in Connecticut. (now closed)  References[edit]   ^ Davis, James D.

While considered a novel approach by some, it has raised controversy amongst enthusiasts and collectors, increasing the amount of difficulty in obtaining a complete collection[citation needed]. Purchases from many retailers make no guarantees regarding the contents of a particular package. Despite attempts to obfuscate the contents of these packages, the bags of Series 1 and 2 have a second figurine-specific bar code on the rear of the packaging, next to the EAN/UPC product bar code (which is unique to each series). This has allowed customers to identify individual figures within the packaging, significantly decreasing the amount of money and effort required to obtain a complete collection, and eliminates the possibility of unintentionally receiving duplicates.[2] There are also apps for both iPhone and Android devices that utilize these bar codes.[3] Lego has eliminated the figurine-specific bar codes on all Series 3 and 4 packages and replaced them with a braille-like system of dots embossed in the lower seal of the bag. In theory, this will allow customers to continue identifying the figure enclosed within.[4][5] Later series do not have any markings to indicate their contents. On average a new mini fig series has been released every 4 months. Release dates sometimes vary between countries. The most recent series was Series 11, which was released on September 1st, 2013 in the United States.

It is owned by The Walt Disney Company through its division Walt Disney Parks and Resorts. The property covers 30,080 acres (12,173ha; 47sqmi), in which it houses 24 themed resorts, four theme parks, two water parks, and several additional recreational and entertainment venues. Magic Kingdom is the original theme park on the complex, and Epcot, Disney's Hollywood Studios, and Disney's Animal Kingdom opened throughout the 1980s and 1990s. Designed to supplement Disneyland in Anaheim, California, which had opened in 1955, Walt Disney developed the complex in the 1960s, though he died in 1966 before construction on \\\"The Florida Project\\\" began. After extensive lobbying, the Government of Florida created the Reedy Creek Improvement District, a special government district that essentially gave The Walt Disney Company the standard powers and autonomy of an incorporated city. Original plans called for the inclusion of an \\\"Experimental Prototype Community of Tomorrow\\\", a planned city that would serve as a test bed for new innovations for city living.

Market surveys revealed that only 5% of Disneyland's visitors came from east of the Mississippi River, where 75% of the population of the United States lived. Additionally, Walt Disney disliked the businesses that had sprung up around Disneyland and wanted control of a much larger area of land for the new project.[1] Walt Disney flew over the Orlando-area site (one of many) in November 1963. Seeing the well-developed network of roads, including the planned Interstate 4 and Florida's Turnpike, with McCoy Air Force Base (later Orlando International Airport) to the east, Disney selected a centrally located site near Bay Lake.[2] To avoid a burst of land speculation, Disney used various dummy corporations to acquire 27,443 acres (11,106ha) of land.[2] In May 1965, some of these major land transactions were recorded a few miles southwest of Orlando in Osceola County. Also, two large tracts totaling $1.5 million were sold, and smaller tracts of flatlands and cattle pastures were purchased by exotic-sounding companies such as the Latin-American Development and Management Corporation and the Reedy Creek Ranch Corporation (Some of these names are now memorialized on a window above Main Street, U.S.A. in the Magic Kingdom). In addition to three huge parcels of land were many smaller parcels, referred to as \\\"outs.\\\" Much of the land acquired had been platted into 5-acre (2ha) lots in 1912 by the Munger Land Company and sold to investors. Most owners were happy to get rid of the land, which was mostly swamp. Another issue was the mineral rights to the land, which were owned by Tufts University. Without the transfer of these rights, Tufts could come in at any time and demand the removal of buildings to obtain minerals. Eventually, Disney's team negotiated a deal with Tufts to buy the mineral rights for $15,000.[3] After most of the land had been bought, the truth of the property's owner was leaked to the Orlando Sentinel newspaper on October 20, 1965. A press conference was organized for November 15, when Walt Disney explained the plans for the site, including EPCOT, the Experimental Prototype Community of Tomorrow, which was to be a futuristic planned city (and which was also known as Progress City). He envisioned a working city with commercial and residential areas that also continued to showcase and test new ideas and concepts for urban living. Walt Disney died from lung cancer on December 15, 1966, before his vision was realized. His brother and business partner, Roy O. Disney, postponed his retirement to oversee construction of the resort's first phase. On February 2, 1967, Roy O. Disney held a press conference at the Park Theatres in Winter Park, Florida. The role of EPCOT was emphasized in the film that was played, the last one recorded by Walt Disney before his death. After the film, it was explained that for Disney World, including EPCOT, to succeed, a special district would have to be formed: the Reedy Creek Improvement District with two cities inside it, Bay Lake and Reedy Creek (now Lake Buena Vista). In addition to the standard powers of an incorporated city, which include the issuance of tax-free bonds, the district would have immunity from any current or future county or state land-use laws. The only areas where the district had to submit to the county and state would be property taxes and elevator inspections.[1] The legislation forming the district and the two cities was signed into law by Florida Governor Claude R. Kirk, Jr. on May 12, 1967. The Florida Supreme Court then ruled in 1968 that the district was allowed to issue tax-exempt bonds for public projects within the district despite the sole beneficiary being Walt Disney Productions. The district soon began construction of drainage canals, and Disney built the first roads and Magic Kingdom. The Contemporary Resort Hotel, the Polynesian Village, and Fort Wilderness were also completed in time for the park's opening on October 1, 1971. The Palm and Magnolia golf courses near Magic Kingdom had opened a few weeks before. At the park's opening, Roy O. Disney dedicated the property and declared that it would be known as \\\"Walt Disney World\\\" in his brother's honor. In his own words: \\\"Everyone has heard of Ford cars. But have they all heard of Henry Ford, who started it all? Walt Disney World is in memory of the man who started it all, so people will know his name as long as Walt Disney World is here.\\\" After the dedication, Roy Disney asked Walt's widow, Lillian, what she thought of Walt Disney World. According to biographer Bob Thomas, she responded, \\\"I think Walt would have approved.\\\" Roy O. Disney died on December 20, 1971, less than three months after the property opened. Much of Walt Disney's plans for his Progress City were abandoned after his death, after the company board decided that it did not want to be in the business of running a city. The concept evolved into the resort's second theme park, EPCOT Center (renamed Epcot in 1996), which opened in 1982. While still emulating Walt Disney's original idea of showcasing new technology, it is closer to a world's fair than a \\\"community of tomorrow\\\". Some of the urban planning concepts from the original idea of EPCOT would instead be integrated into the community of Celebration much later. The resort's third theme park, Disney-MGM Studios (renamed Disney's Hollywood Studios in 2008), opened in 1989, and is inspired by show business. The resort's fourth theme park, Disney's Animal Kingdom, opened in 1998. George Kalogridis was named president of the resort in December 2012, replacing Meg Crofton, who had overseen the site since 2006. Timeline[edit]     Walt Disney (left) with his brother Roy O.

One of four arches welcoming guests to the resort.   Despite marketing claims and popular misconceptions, the Florida resort is not within Orlando city limits, but is actually about 21 miles (34km) southwest of downtown Orlando, much of it in southwestern Orange County, with the remainder in adjacent Osceola County. The property includes the cities of Lake Buena Vista and Bay Lake which are governed by the Reedy Creek Improvement District. The 25,000 acres (10,117ha; 39sqmi)[4] site is accessible from Central Florida's Interstate 4 via Exits 62B (World Drive), 64B (US 192 West), 65B (Osceola Parkway West), 67B (SR 536 West), and 68 (SR 535 North), and Exit 8 on State Road 429 (Florida), the Western Expressway. At its peak, the resort occupied approximately 30,000 acres (12,141ha; 47sqmi), about the size of San Francisco, or twice the size of Manhattan. Portions of the property since have been sold or de-annexed, including land now occupied by the Disney-built community of Celebration.

The four 18-hole golf courses are the Palm (4 Stars), the Magnolia (4 Stars), Lake Buena Vista (4 Stars) and Osprey Ridge (4 Stars). There is also a nine-hole walking course (no electric carts allowed) called Oak Trail, designed for young golfers. The Magnolia and Palm courses play home to the PGA Tour's Children's Miracle Network Hospitals Classic. Arnold Palmer Golf Management manages the Disney golf courses.[5] Additionally, there are two themed miniature golf complexes, each with two courses, Fantasia Gardens and Winter Summerland. Catch-and-release fishing excursions are offered daily on the resort's lakes. A Florida fishing license is not required because it occurs on private property. Cane-pole fishing is offered from the docks at Disney's Fort Wilderness Resort & Campground and Disney's Port Orleans Resort. Additional recreational activities include watercraft rentals, surrey bike rentals, and firework cruises that launch from several resort marinas. Former attractions[edit]  Disney's River Country: The first water park at the Walt Disney World Resort. It opened on June 20, 1976 and closed on November 1, 2001. Discovery Island: An island in Bay Lake which was home to many species of animals and birds. It opened on April 8, 1974 and closed on April 8, 1999.  Resorts[edit] Of the thirty-four resorts and hotels on the Walt Disney World property, twenty-four are owned and operated by Walt Disney Parks and Resorts. These are classified into four categories: Deluxe, Moderate, Value, and Disney Vacation Club Villas, and are located in one of five resort areas: the Magic Kingdom, Epcot, Disney's Hollywood Studios, Animal Kingdom, or Downtown Disney resort areas. Disney's Grand Floridian Resort & Spa is the flagship resort of Walt Disney World.[6] On-site Disney resorts[edit]   Name Opening Date Theme Number of Rooms Area   Deluxe resorts   Disney's Animal Kingdom Lodge April 16, 2001 African Wildlife preserve 1,307 Animal Kingdom   Disney's Beach Club Resort November 19, 1990 Newport Beach cottage 576 Epcot   Disney's BoardWalk Inn July 1, 1996 Early 20th Century Atlantic and Ocean City 378   Disney's Contemporary Resort October 1, 1971 Modern 655 Magic Kingdom   Disney's Grand Floridian Resort & Spa July 1, 1988 Victorian seaside resort 867   Disney's Polynesian Resort October 1, 1971 South Seas 847   Disney's Wilderness Lodge May 28, 1994 Pacific Northwest 729   Disney's Yacht Club Resort November 5, 1990 Martha's Vineyard Resort 621 Epcot   Moderate resorts   Disney's Caribbean Beach Resort October 1, 1988 Tropical Islands 2,112 Epcot   Disney's Coronado Springs Resort August 1, 1997 American Southwest 1,915 Animal Kingdom   Disney's Port Orleans Resort French Quarter May 17, 1991 New Orleans French Quarter 1,008 Downtown Disney   Disney's Port Orleans Resort Riverside February 2, 1992 Antebellum South 2,048   Value resorts   Disney's All-Star Movies Resort January 15, 1999 Disney films 1,920 Animal Kingdom   Disney's All-Star Music Resort November 22, 1994 Music 1,604   Disney's All-Star Sports Resort April 24, 1994 Sports 1,920   Disney's Art of Animation Resort May 31, 2012 Disney films 1,984 Disney's Hollywood Studios   Disney's Pop Century Resort December 14, 2003 20th century American pop culture 2,880   Disney Vacation Club   Disney's Old Key West Resort December 20, 1991 Early 20th Century Key West 761 Downtown Disney   Disney's BoardWalk Villas July 1, 1996 Early 20th Century Atlantic City 583 Epcot   The Villas at Disney's Wilderness Lodge November 15, 2000 Pacific Northwest 136 Magic Kingdom   Disney's Beach Club Villas July 1, 2002 Newport resort 282 Epcot   Disney's Saratoga Springs Resort & Spa May 17, 2004 1880s Upstate New York resort 1,260 Downtown Disney   Disney's Animal Kingdom Villas August 15, 2007 African safari lodge 458 Animal Kingdom   Bay Lake Tower August 4, 2009 Modern 428 Magic Kingdom   The Villas at Disney's Grand Floridian & Spa October 23, 2013 Victorian Seaside Resort 147 Magic Kingdom   Cabins and campgrounds   Disney's Fort Wilderness Resort and Campground November 19, 1971 Rustic Woods Camping 800 campsites 409 cabins Magic Kingdom   Residential areas   Golden Oak at Walt Disney World Resort Fall 2011 Varies 450 homes Magic Kingdom          The Grand Floridian Resort and Spa, Walt Disney World's flagship resort          Disney's Polynesian Resort, a deluxe level resort          Caribbean Beach Resort, the first moderate resort at Walt Disney World          Fort Wilderness, Disney's campground and cabin resort          Disney's All Star Movies Resort, one of five value resorts     On-site non-Disney hotels[edit]   Hotel Name Opening Date Theme Number of Rooms Owner Area   Best Western Lake Buena Vista Resort Hotel November 21, 1972 None 325 Best Western Downtown Disney   Doubletree Guest Suite Resort March 15, 1987 229 Hilton Hotels Corporation   Wyndham Lake Buena Vista October 15, 1972 626 Wyndham Hotels & Resorts   Hilton Walt Disney World November 23, 1983 787 Hilton Hotels Corporation   Holiday Inn in the Walt Disney World Resort February 8, 1973 323 InterContinental Hotels Group   Royal Plaza October 1, 1972 394 N/A   Buena Vista Palace Resort & Spa March 10, 1983 1,014 Blackstone Group   Shades of Green February 1, 1994 Upscale Country Club 586 United States Department of Defense Magic Kingdom   Walt Disney World Dolphin June 1, 1990 Underwater 1,509 Starwood Hotels and Resorts Worldwide Epcot   Walt Disney World Swan January 13, 1990 Underwater 756          Shades of Green Resort, owned and operated by the United States Military          The Walt Disney World Dolphin, a Starwood Resort          The Walt Disney World Swan, a Starwood Resort          Double Tree Guest Suites, located at Hotel Plaza Boulevard          The Hilton at Walt Disney World, located at Hotel Plaza Boulevard     Former resorts[edit]  The Golf Resort Became The Disney Inn, and later became Shades of Green. Disney's Village Resort Became the Villas at Disney Institute and then Disney's Saratoga Springs Resort & Spa. The \\\"Tree House\\\" Villas were decommissioned for a time because they were not accessible to disabled guests. Until early 2008, they were used for International Program Cast Member housing. In February 2008, Disney submitted plans to the South Florida Water Management District to replace the 60 existing villas with 60 new villas.[7] The Treehouse Villas opened during the summer of 2009. Celebration (A town designed and built by Disney, now managed by a resident run association.) Lake Buena Vista (Disney originally intended this area to become a complete community with multiple residences, shopping, and offices, but transformed the original homes into hotel lodging in the 1970s, which were demolished in the early 2000s to build Disney's Saratoga Springs Resort & Spa)  Proposed resorts[edit]  Disney's Asian Resort Disney's Persian Resort Disney's Venetian Resort Disney's Mediterranean Resort Fort Wilderness Junction  Disney's Magical Express[edit]     Disney's Magical Express logo.   Guests with a Disney Resort reservation arriving at Orlando International Airport can be transported to their resort from the airport using the complimentary Disney Magical Express service, which is operated by Mears Destination Services as Walt Disney World does not provide transportation off resort property. Guests can also have their bags picked up and transported for them through a contract with BAGS Incorporated. Mears operates custom motor coaches and luggage is delivered to the guests' rooms by BAGS. Disney Cruise Line buses are also operated by Mears.

Today it employs more than 66,000, spending more than $1.2 billion on payroll and $474 million on benefits each year. The largest single-site employer in the United States,[8] Walt Disney World has more than 3,700 job classifications. The resort also sponsors and operates the Walt Disney World College Program, an internship program that offers American college students (CP's) the opportunity to live about 15 miles (24km) off site in 4 Disney-owned apartment complexes and work at the resort, providing much of the theme park and resort \\\"front line\\\" cast members. There is also the Walt Disney World International College Program, an internship program that offers International college students (ICP's) from all over the world the same opportunity. Maintenance[edit] In a March 30, 2004 article in The Orlando Sentinel, then-Walt Disney World president Al Weiss gave some insight into how the parks are maintained:  More than 5,000 cast members are dedicated to maintenance and engineering, including 750 horticulturists and 600 painters. Disney spends more than $100 million every year on maintenance at the Magic Kingdom. In 2003, $6 million was spent on renovating its Crystal Palace restaurant. 90 percent of guests say that the upkeep and cleanliness of the Magic Kingdom are excellent or very good. The streets in the parks are steam cleaned every night. There are cast members permanently assigned to painting the antique carousel horses; they use genuine gold leaf. There is a tree farm on site so that when a mature tree needs to be replaced, a thirty-year-old tree will be available to replace it.  Transportation[edit]     A Disney bus, one of the transportation modes within Walt Disney World   A fleet of Disney-operated buses on property, branded Disney Transport, is complimentary for guests. In 2007, Disney Transport started a guest services upgrade to the buses. SatellGPS systems controlling new public address systems on the buses give safety information, park tips and other general announcements, with music. They are not to be confused with the Disney Cruise Line and Disney's Magical Express buses, which are operated by Mears Transportation. The Walt Disney World Monorail System also provides transportation at Walt Disney World. They operate on three routes that interconnect at the Transportation and Ticket Center (TTC), adjacent to the Magic Kingdom's parking lot. One line provides an express non-stop link from the TTC to the Magic Kingdom, while a second line provides a link from the TTC to Epcot. The third line links the TTC and the Magic Kingdom to the Contemporary, Polynesian, and Grand Floridian resorts. Disney Transport also operates a fleet of watercraft, ranging in size from water taxis up to the ferries that connect the Magic Kingdom to the Transportation and Ticket Center. The major roads within the resort (World Drive, Osceola Parkway and Epcot Center Drive) have segments that are built as freeways with full grade-separated interchanges. World Drive enters Walt Disney World from U.S. Route 192 and heads north to the Magic Kingdom Resort Area. Osceola Parkway heads east from the Animal Kingdom Resort Area to Interstate 4. Epcot Center Drive is a freeway for most of its route, running east from World Drive, past the Epcot parking lot to Interstate 4. Buena Vista Drive is a major surface street, running east from the Animal Kingdom Resort Area to Disney's Hollywood Studios, the Epcot Resort Area, and Downtown Disney. Name and logo[edit] During the resort's early planning stages, Walt Disney referred to the project as Project X, The Florida Project, Disney World, and The Disney World. Early visual references used the same medieval font as Disneyland. Walt Disney was very involved in the site selection and project planning in the years before his death. The secretive names were chosen because of the high confidentiality of the project during the initial planning. After Walt Disney's death, Roy O. Disney added the name Walt to Disney World as a permanent tribute to his brother. The original logo had an over-sized \\\"D\\\" with a Mickey Mouse-shaped globe containing latitude and longitude lines, with the property's name presented in a modern, sans-serif font. It was retired during its 25th anniversary celebration in 199697, but can still be found in many places, including the SpectroMagic title float, the front car of each monorail, manhole covers, survey markers, select merchandise items and flags flown at several sites across the property. Twin town[edit] As part of a competition run by Disney for 2010, Walt Disney World has an unofficial twinning (sister city) with Swindon, England, since 2009.[9][10] Rebecca Warren's submission to the competition granted Swindon to be the twin town of Walt Disney World, which is famous for its intersection with six roundabouts. Warren and the mayor of Swindon were invited to a \\\"twinning\\\" ceremony, where a plaque revealing the connection will be placed.[11] See also[edit]  Incidents at Walt Disney World Resort Walt Disney Travel Company, Incorporated Walt Disney World Casting Center Walt Disney World College Program Walt Disney World Company Walt Disney World Explorer Walt Disney World Hospitality and Recreation Corporation Walt Disney World International Program  References[edit]   ^ a b Fogleson, Richard E.

The announcement stated that it would be a \\\"natural\\\" park and revealed the park's iconic Dolphin Plunge water slides.[1] On March 5, 2007, SeaWorld held a press conference officially announcing Aquatica.[2] It was expected the 59-acre (24ha) park would cost US$50 million to build.[2] Construction continued in earnest throughout 2007 and into early 2008. Previews for employees and holders of park annual passes were held in February. On March 1, 2008, the park opened to guests for the first time, with the official grand opening held on April 4, 2008.[3] In its debut year, the park hosted approximately 950,000 guests, making it the fourth-most visited water park in the United States and eighth-most visited in the world.[4] The park was an immediate success, reaching its opening-year attendance goal in just six months.[4] In early 2011, rumors speculated about Aquatica coming to SeaWorld San Antonio in the future. According to the park president, SeaWorld San Antonio would become a multi-day experience.[5] SeaWorld officially announced plans to build a water park on May 24, 2011. The announcement called it, \\\"a whimsical waterpark with up-close animal experiences, high-speed thrills and relaxing, sandy beaches\\\".[6] The water park replaced Lost Lagoon that opened in the early 1990s. Lost Lagoon closed on Labor Day weekend 2011. During October 2011 the construction of the new water park started with excavation for the new entrance, the new sandy beaches, and the structure for the new Wahalla Wave water slide. In early November 2011 the new water slides arrived in pieces at Sea World San Antonio's parking lot, waiting to get assembled.[7] Aquatica San Antonio officially opened on May 19, 2012.[8] On November 20, 2012, Cedar Fair announced it had sold its San Diego Soak City park to SeaWorld Parks & Entertainment.[9] The water park originally opened on May 31, 1997, under the name White Water Canyon. At the time it featured 16 water slides and a wave pool.[10] In December 1999, Cedar Fair purchased the park for $11.5 million and renamed it Knott's Soak City U.S.A..[11] The water park had opened with a new beach theme in May 2000.[12] The acquisition by SeaWorld Parks & Entertainment will see the park transformed into a 32-acre (13ha) water park named Aquatica San Diego. The refurbished park reopened on June 1, 2013.[9][13] Locations[edit]   Park name Location Coordinates Opening date Ref.

Headquartered in Boston's Back Bay, it publishes textbooks, instructional technology materials, assessments, reference works, and fiction and non-fiction for both young readers and adults.

History[edit] In 1832, William Ticknor and James Thomas Fields had gathered an impressive list of writers, including Ralph Waldo Emerson, Nathaniel Hawthorne, and Henry David Thoreau. The duo formed a close relationship with Riverside Press, a Boston printing company owned by Henry Oscar Houghton. Shortly after, Houghton also founded a publishing company with partner George Mifflin. In 1880, Ticknor and Fields and Houghton and Mifflin merged their operations, combining the literary works of writers with the expertise of a publisher and creating a new partnership named Houghton, Mifflin and Company. The company still had debt from when it merged from Houghton, Osgood and Company, so it decided to add partners. In 1884, James D. Hurd, the son of Melancthon Hurd became a partner. Three people in 1888 became partners as well: James Murray Kay, Thurlow Weed Barnes, and Henry Oscar Houghton, Jr. Shortly thereafter the company established an Educational Department, and from 1891 to 1908 sales of educational materials increased by 500 percent. Soon after 1916, Houghton Mifflin became involved in publishing standardized tests and testing materials, working closely with such test developers as E.F. Lindquist. The company was the fourth-largest educational publisher in the United States in 1921. In 1961, Houghton Mifflin famously passed on Julia Child's Mastering the Art of French Cooking, giving it up to Alfred A. Knopf who later published it in 1962. It went on to become an overnight success and is considered by many to be the bible of French cooking. Houghton Mifflin's strategic error was depicted in the 2009 film Julie & Julia.[unreliable source?] In 1967, Houghton Mifflin became a publicly traded company on the New York Stock Exchange under the stock symbol HTN. The company is currently privately held and no longer trades under this symbol. Under (new from 1991) president Nader F. Darehshori Houghton Mifflin acquired in 1994 for $138 million[3] McDougal Littell, an educational publisher of secondary school materials, and in following year D.C. Heath and Company,[4] a publisher of supplemental educational resources. In 1996, the company created their Great Source Education Group to combine the supplemental material product lines of their School Division and these two companies. Creation of Houghton Mifflin Harcourt[edit] Mergers and acquisitions (M&A) activities have had major effects on this company. Vivendi purchase[edit] In 2001, Houghton Mifflin was acquired by French media giant Vivendi Universal for $2.2 billion including assumed debt. In 2002, facing mounting financial and legal pressures, Vivendi sold Houghton to private equity investors Thomas H. Lee Partners, Bain Capital, and Blackstone Group for $1.66 billion, including assumed debt (approximately 25% less than Vivendi had paid a year earlier).[5][6] Riverdeep merger with Houghton Mifflin[edit] On December 22, 2006, it was announced that Riverdeep PLC had completed its acquisition of Houghton Mifflin. The new joint enterprise would be called the Houghton Mifflin Riverdeep Group. Riverdeep paid $1.75 billion in cash and assumed $1.61 billion in debt from the private investment firms Thomas H. Lee Partners, Bain Capital and Blackstone Group.[7] Tony Lucki, a former non-executive director of Riverdeep, remained in his position as the company's chief executive officer until April 2009.[8] Houghton Mifflin sold its professional testing unit, Promissor, to Pearson plc in 2006. The company combined its remaining assessment products within Riverside Publishing, including San Francisco-based Edusoft. Harcourt merger[edit] On July 16, 2007 Houghton Mifflin Riverdeep announced that it signed a definitive agreement to acquire the Harcourt Education, Harcourt Trade and Greenwood-Heinemann divisions of Reed Elsevier for $4 billion. The expanded company would become Houghton Mifflin Harcourt. McDougal Littell was merged with Harcourt's Holt, Rinehart & Winston to form Holt McDougal On December 3, 2007, Cengage Learning (formerly Thomson Learning) announced that it had agreed to acquire the assets of the Houghton Mifflin College Division for $750 million, pending regulatory approval. On November 25, 2008, Houghton Mifflin Harcourt announced a temporary freeze on acquisition of new trade division titles, allegedly in response to the economic crisis of 2008.[9] The publisher of the trade division resigned, apparently in protest.[10] Many observers familiar with the publishing industry saw the move as a devastating blunder.[11][12] Harcourt Religion was sold to Our Sunday Visitor in 2009 [13] Houghton Mifflin Harcourt restructuring[edit] On July 27, 2009, the Irish Independent newspaper reported that Houghton Mifflin Harcourt's controlling shareholder EMPG was in the process of a re-structuring negotiations with its unsecured-debt holders that would lead to the conversion of the debt into equity. The news story reported that the unsecured debt holders would receive a 45% equity stake. As a result, the royal family of Dubai via their Istithmar World Capital investment vehicle became major stakeholders.[14] Estimates were that EMPG would cut its debt from $7.3bn to $6.1bn. On August 15, 2009, the Financial Times newspaper reported in an interview with Houghton Mifflin Harcourt's CEO at the time, Barry O'Callaghan, that the refinancing had received approval of more than 90% of lenders. The terms included the holding company debt converting into 45% of the fully diluted common equity, an effective 25 per cent relaxation of financial covenants, second lien lenders agreeing to convert their holdings into a PIK instrument, reducing annual interest costs by $100m, and a further $50m increase its working capital facility.[15] Second round restructuring[edit] A further restructuring of Houghton Mifflin Harcourt's debts was confirmed by the company on 13 January 2010.[16] The proposed restructuring materially impacted the shareholders of EMPG, the former holding company of Houghton Mifflin Harcourt.[17] Recapitalization in 2010[edit] On 22 February 2010, Houghton Mifflin Harcourt announced that EMPG and HMH had reached an agreement to restructure the finances of the company and recapitalize its balance sheet with a substantial fresh cash investment by institutional investors.[18] The agreement, supported by 100% of HMH's creditors, highlighted a reduction in the senior debt to $3 billion from the current $5 billion, with new equity issued to the senior debt holders (including Paulson & Co. and Guggenheim Partners),[19] conversion of the $2 billion mezzanine debt into equity and warrant, receipt of $650m of new cash from the sale of new equity. In addition to the key highlights, HMH announced its new $100m Innovation Fund, to invest in the next generation of technology for the education industry. The Irish Times[20] reported that the investments by the then equity holders of EMPG, including HMH's CEO at the time, Barry O'Callaghan, private clients of Davy Stockbrokers, Reed Elsevier, and others of over $3.5 billion would be written down to zero. Additionally, the Irish Independent reported that following the restructuring, the investors of EMPG would have a nominal investment in Houghton Mifflin Harcourt via warrants over 5% of the company if it exceeded the $10 billion valuation[21] placed on the company at the time of the merger between Houghton Mifflin Riverdeep and Harcourt. In addition to the warrants in HMH, the EMPG shareholders would continue to own a stake in the international investment vehicle, EMPGI which has stakes in China, the Middle East and elsewhere. The Financial Times reported[22] that no management changes were expected as part of the deal with both the CEO at the time, Barry O'Callaghan and the CFO, Michael Muldowney expected to remain in their roles. The Times reported that a new nine-member board was to be created with the CEO the only executive representative, one independent, two representative of Paulson & Co, and one director from each of Apollo, BlackRock, Guggenheim Partners, Fidelity and Avenue Capital. On 10 March 2010, Houghton Mifflin Harcourt announced that it had completed its re-capitalization.[23] In addition to a new investment of $ 650 million of equity, the debt levels of the company were reduced by approximately 60% and the annual interest payments by over 75%. According the Irish State Broadcaster, RTE, the old equity investors based in Ireland has lost all their investment.[24] The Irish Independent reported that the old shareholders were denied a shareholders meeting to vote or discuss the restructuring.[25] The former shareholders have been left with warrants over 5% of the company, in the case its value recovers to previous levels. On 19 September 2011, it was announced that Linda K. Zecher would be replacing Barry O'Callahan as Chief Executive Officer and Director of Houghton Mifflin Harcourt after O'Callahan resigned. Zecher went to HMH from Microsoft. She currently works in the corporate headquarters in Boston.[citation needed] Awards and accolades[edit] Curious George At the Zoo was rated a Top Ten app under the Education Games category for the iPad, iPhone and iPod Touch in 2012.[26] Go George Go!, a mobile app for preschoolers, received the Editor's Choice Award from the Children's Technology Review in 2011.[27] Go Math!, a K6 product, was named a Reader's Choice Top 100 product by District Administration in 2010.[28]  Criticism and controversies[edit] The company was ranked the 10th worst place to work in America, according to a glassdoor.com survey in 2009.[29] References[edit]   ^ \\\"Pronunciation Guide.\\\" Houghton Mifflin.

He was killed by Indian agency police on the Standing Rock Indian Reservation during an attempt to arrest him at a time when authorities feared that he would join the Ghost Dance movement.[3] Before the Battle of the Little Bighorn, Sitting Bull had a vision in which he saw the defeat of the 7th Cavalry under Lt. Col. George Armstrong Custer on June 25, 1876. Sitting Bull's leadership motivated his people to a major victory. Months after their victory at the battle, Sitting Bull and his group left the United States for Wood Mountain, Saskatchewan, where he remained until 1881, at which time he surrendered to U.S. forces. A small remnant of his band under Chief Wabl  decided to stay at Wood Mountain. After working as a performer, Sitting Bull returned to the Standing Rock Agency in South Dakota. Because of fears that he would use his influence to support the Ghost Dance movement, Indian Service agent James McLaughlin at Fort Yates ordered his arrest. During an ensuing struggle between Sitting Bull's followers and the agency police, Sitting Bull was shot in the side and head by Standing Rock policemen Lieutenant Bull Head (Tatankapah) and Red Tomahawk (Marcelus Chankpidutah) after the police were fired upon by Sitting Bull's supporters. His body was taken to nearby Fort Yates for burial, but in 1953, his remains were possibly exhumed and reburied near Mobridge, South Dakota, by his Lakota family, who wanted his body to be nearer to his birthplace.

Despite being embroiled in the American Civil War, the United States Army retaliated in 1863 and 1864, even against bands which had not been involved in the hostilities.[8] In 1864, two brigades of about 2200 soldiers under Brigadier General Alfred Sully attacked a village. The defenders were led by Sitting Bull, Gall and Inkpaduta.[8] The Sioux were driven out, but skirmishing continued into August.[citation needed] In September, Sitting Bull and about 100 Hunkpapa Sioux came across a small party near what is now Marmarth, North Dakota. They had been left behind by a wagon train commanded by Captain James L. Fisk to effect some repairs to an overturned wagon. When he led an attack, Sitting Bull was shot in the left hip by a soldier.[8] The bullet exited out through the small of his back, and the wound was not too serious.[9] Red Cloud's War[edit] Sitting Bull led numerous war parties against Fort Berthold, Fort Stevenson, and Fort Buford and their environs from 1865 through 1868.[10] Although Red Cloud was a leader of the Oglala Sioux, his leadership and attacks against forts in the Powder River Country of Montana were supported by Sitting Bull's guerrilla attacks on emigrant parties and smaller forts throughout the upper Missouri River region.[citation needed] By early 1868, the U.S. government desired a peaceful settlement to Red Cloud's War. It agreed to Red Cloud's demands that Forts Phil Kearny and C.F. Smith be abandoned. Chief Gall of the Hunkpapas (among other representatives of the Hunkpapas, Blackfeet, and Yankton Sioux) signed a form of the Treaty of Fort Laramie on July 2, 1868 at Fort Rice (near Bismarck, North Dakota).[11] Sitting Bull did not agree to the treaty. He continued his hit-and-run attacks on forts in the upper Missouri area throughout the late 1860s and early 1870s.[12] The events of 1868 mark a historically debated period of Sitting Bull's life. According to historian Stanley Vestal, who conducted interviews with surviving Hunkpapa in 1930, Sitting Bull was made \\\"Supreme Chief of the whole Sioux Nation\\\" at this time. Later historians and ethnologists have refuted this concept of authority, as the Lakota society was highly decentralised. Lakota bands and their elders made individual decisions.[13] The Great Sioux War of 1876[edit] For more details on this topic, see Great Sioux War of 1876.     Early Cabinet card of Sitting Bull, 1881.   Sitting Bull's band of Hunkpapa continued to attack migrating parties and forts in the late 1860s. When in 1871 the Northern Pacific Railway conducted a survey for a route across the northern plains directly through Hunkpapa lands, it encountered stiff Sioux resistance.[14] The same railway people returned the following year accompanied by federal troops. Sitting Bull and the Hunkpapa attacked the survey party, which was forced to turn back.[15] In 1873, the military accompaniment for the surveyors was increased again, but Sitting Bull's forces resisted the survey \\\"most vigorously.\\\"[16] The Panic of 1873 forced the Northern Pacific Railway's backers (such as Jay Cooke) into bankruptcy. This halted construction of the railroad through Sioux territory. After the discovery and new wealth from gold in California, other men became interested in the potential for gold mining in the Black Hills. In 1874, Lt. Col. George Armstrong Custer led a military expedition from Fort Abraham Lincoln near Bismarck, to explore the Black Hills for gold and to determine a suitable location for a military fort in the Hills.[17] Custer's announcement of gold in the Black Hills triggered the Black Hills Gold Rush. Tensions increased between the Sioux and European Americans' seeking to move into the Black Hills.[18] Although Sitting Bull did not attack Custer's expedition in 1874, the US government was increasingly pressured to open the Black Hills to mining and settlement. It was alarmed at reports of Sioux depredations (encouraged by Sitting Bull). In November 1875, the government ordered all Sioux bands outside the Great Sioux Reservation to move onto the reservation, knowing full well that not all would comply. As of February 1, 1876, the Interior Department certified as \\\"hostile\\\" those bands who continued to live off the reservation.[19] This certification allowed the military to pursue Sitting Bull and other Lakota bands as \\\"hostiles\\\". According to the historian Margot Liberty, many Lakota bands allied with the Cheyenne during the Plains Wars because they thought the other nation was under attack by the US. Given this connection, she suggests the major war should have been called \\\"The Great Cheyenne War\\\". Since 1860, the Northern Cheyenne had led several battles among the Plains Indians. Before 1876, the US Army had destroyed seven Cheyenne camps, more than those of any other nation.[20] However, other historians such as Robert M. Utley[21] and Jerome Greene[22][23] also use Lakota oral testimony as the basis for their conclusions that the Lakota coalition, of which Sitting Bull was the ostensible head, was the primary target of the federal government's pacification campaign. Battle of the Little Bighorn[edit] For more details on this topic, see Battle of the Little Bighorn.     Little Bighorn battlefield   During the period 18681876, Sitting Bull developed into the most important of Native American chiefs. After the Treaty of Fort Laramie (1868) and the creation of the Great Sioux Reservation, many traditional Sioux warriors, such as Red Cloud of the Oglala and Spotted Tail of the Brul, moved to reside permanently on the reservations. They were largely dependent for subsistence on the US Indian agencies. Many other chiefs, including members of Sitting Bull's Hunkpapa band such as Gall, at times lived temporarily at the agencies. They needed the supplies at a time when white encroachment and the depletion of buffalo herds reduced their resources and challenged Native American independence.[citation needed] In 1875, the Northern Cheyenne, Hunkpapa, Oglala, Sans Arc, and Minneconjou camped together for a Sun Dance, with both the Cheyenne medicine man White Bull or Ice and Sitting Bull in association. This ceremonial alliance preceded their fighting together in 1876.[20] Sitting Bull had a major revelation.  At the climactic moment, \\\"Sitting Bull intoned, 'The Great Spirit has given our enemies to us. We are to destroy them. We do not know who they are. They may be soldiers.' Ice too observed, 'No one then knew who the enemy were  of what tribe.'...They were soon to find out.\\\"(Utley 1992: 12224)  Sitting Bull's refusal to adopt any dependence on the white man meant that at times he and his small band of warriors lived isolated on the Plains. When Native Americans were threatened by the United States, numerous members from various Sioux bands and other tribes, such as the North Cheyenne, came to Sitting Bull's camp. His reputation for \\\"strong medicine\\\" developed as he continued to evade the European Americans.     Sketch of Sitting Bull; Harper's Weekly, December 8, 1877 issue.   After the January 1st ultimatum of 1876, when the US Army began to track down Sioux and others living off the reservation as hostiles, Native Americans gathered at Sitting Bull's camp. The chief took an active role in encouraging this \\\"unity camp\\\". He sent scouts to the reservations to recruit warriors, and told the Hunkpapa to share supplies with those Native Americans who joined them. An example of his generosity was Sitting Bull's taking care of Wooden Leg's Northern Cheyenne tribe. They had been impoverished by Captain Reynold's March 17, 1876 attack and fled to Sitting Bull's camp for safety.[20] The Hunkpapa chief provided resources to sustain the new recruits. Over the course of the first half of 1876, Sitting Bull's camp continually expanded, as natives joined him for safety in numbers. His leadership had attracted the warriors and families of an extensive village, estimated at more than 10,000 people. Lt. Col. Custer came across this large camp on June 25, 1876. Sitting Bull did not take a direct military role in the ensuing battle; instead he acted as a spiritual chief and had performed the Sun Dance, in which he fasted and sacrificed over 100 pieces of flesh from his arms, a week prior to the attack.[4] Custers 7th Cavalry advance party attacked Cheyenne and Lakota tribes at their camp on the Little Big Horn River (known as the Greasy Grass River to the Lakota) on June 25, 1876. The U.S. Army did not realize how large the camp was. More than 2,000 Native American warriors had left their reservations to follow Sitting Bull. Inspired by a vision of Sitting Bulls, in which he saw U.S. soldiers being killed as they entered the tribes camp, the Cheyenne and Lakota fought back. Custer's badly outnumbered troops lost ground quickly and were forced to retreat. The tribes led a counter-attack against the soldiers on a nearby ridge, ultimately annihilating them.[24] The Native Americans' victory celebrations were short-lived. Public shock and outrage at Custer's death and defeat, and the government's knowledge about the remaining Sioux, led them to assign thousands more soldiers to the area. Over the next year, the new American military forces pursued the Lakota, forcing many of the Native Americans to surrender. Sitting Bull refused to surrender and in May 1877 led his band across the border into Saskatchewan, Canada. He remained in exile for four years near Wood Mountain, refusing a pardon and the chance to return.[25] When crossing the border into Saskatchewan, Sitting Bull was met by the Canadian Mounties of the region. During this meeting, James Morrow Walsh, commander of the North-West Mounted Police, explained to Sitting Bull that the Lakota were now on British soil and must obey British law. Walsh emphasized that he enforced the law equally and that every person in the territory had a right to justice. Walsh became an advocate for Sitting Bull and the two became good friends for the remainder of their lives.[26] Also while in Canada Sitting Bull met with chief Crowfoot, who was a chief of the Blackfeet, long-time powerful enemies of the Lakota and Cheyenne. Sitting Bull wished to make peace with the Blackfeet Nation and Crowfoot. Being an advocate for peace himself, Crowfoot eagerly accepted the tobacco peace offering. Sitting Bull was so impressed by the Blackfeet chief that he named one of his sons after him.[27] Sitting Bull and his men only stayed in Canada for 4 years. Due to the smaller size of the buffalo herds in Canada, Sitting Bull and his men found it difficult to find enough food to feed his people, who were starving and exhausted. Furthermore, due to Sitting Bulls presence in the country, there had been a growth in tension between the Canadian and the United States governments.[28] Before Sitting Bull left Saskatchewan, he may have visited Walsh for a final time and left a ceremonial headdress as a memento.[29] Surrender[edit]     Fort Buford's original 1872 Commanding Officer's Quarters where Sitting Bull's surrender ceremony was held   Hunger and desperation eventually forced Sitting Bull, and 186 of his family and followers to return to the United States and surrender on July 19, 1881. Sitting Bull had his young son Crow Foot surrender his Winchester lever-action carbine to Major David H. Brotherton, commanding officer of Fort Buford in the parlor of the Commanding Officer's Quarters in a ceremony the next day. He told the 4 soldiers, 20 warriors and other guests in the small room, that he wished to regard the soldiers and the white race as friends but he wanted to know who would teach his son the new ways of the world. Two weeks later, after waiting in vain for other members of his tribe to follow him from Canada, the Army transferred Sitting Bull and his band to Fort Yates, the military post located adjacent to the Standing Rock Agency, which straddles the present-day boundary of North and South Dakota.[citation needed] Sitting Bull and his band of 186 people were kept separate from the other Hunkpapa gathered at the agency. Army officials were concerned that the famed chief would stir up trouble among the recently surrendered northern bands. On August 26, 1881, he was visited by the census taker William T. Selwyn, who counted twelve people in the Hunkpapa leader's immediate family. Forty-one families, totaling 195 people, were recorded in Sitting Bull's band.[30] The military decided to transfer him and his band to Fort Randall, to be held as prisoners of war. Loaded onto a steamboat, the band of 172 people was sent down the Missouri River to Fort Randall (near present-day Pickstown, South Dakota on the southern border of the state). There they spent the next 20 months. They were allowed to return north to the Standing Rock Agency in May 1883.[citation needed] Wild West Show participation[edit] In 1885, Sitting Bull was allowed to leave the reservation to go Wild Westing with Buffalo Bill Codys Buffalo Bill's Wild West. He got about $50 a week for riding once around the arena, where he was a popular attraction. Although it is rumored that he cursed his audiences in his native tongue during the show, the historian Utley contends that he did not.[31] Historians have reported that Sitting Bull gave speeches about his desire for education for the young, and reconciling relations between the Sioux and whites.[32] The historian Edward Lazarus wrote that Sitting Bull reportedly cursed his audience in Lakota in 1884, during an opening address celebrating the completion of the Northern Pacific Railway.[33] During his participation with the Wild West show, Sitting Bull met Annie Oakley. He was so impressed with Oakley's skills with firearms that he offered $65 for a photographer to take a photo of the two together.[34] The admiration and respect of was mutual. Oakley stated that Sitting Bull made a \\\"great pet\\\" of her.[35] Over time, Sitting Bull's respect for the young sharpshooter grew. Oakley was quite modest in her attire, deeply respectful of others and had a remarkable stage persona despite being a woman who stood only five feet in height. Sitting Bull felt that she was \\\"gifted\\\" by supernatural means in order to shoot so accurately with both hands. As a result of his esteem, he adopted her as a daughter in 1884. He named her \\\"Little Sure Shot\\\" -- a name that Oakley used throughout her career.[36] Sitting Bull stayed with the show for four months before returning home. During that time, audiences began to consider him a celebrity and a romanticized warrior. He earned a small fortune by charging for his autograph and picture, although he often gave his money away to the homeless and beggars.[37] Conversion[edit] In 1883, rumors floated that Sitting Bull had been baptized into the Catholic Church. James McLaughlin, Indian agent at Standing Rock Agency, dismissed these reports, saying that \\\"The reported baptism of Sitting-Bull is erroneous. There is no immediate prospect of such ceremony so far as I am aware.\\\" [38][39][40] Death and burial[edit]     \\\"Wild scene\\\", \\\"Squaws death chant heard in every direction\\\"       Monument at Sitting Bull's grave, Mobridge, South Dakota, 2003   Sitting Bull returned to the Standing Rock Agency after working in Buffalo Bill's Wild West Show. In 1890, James McLaughlin, the U.S. Indian Agent at Fort Yates on Standing Rock Agency, feared that the Lakota leader was about to flee the reservation with the Ghost Dancers, so he ordered the police to arrest him.[41] On December 14, 1890, McLaughlin drafted a letter to Lt. Henry Bullhead that included instructions and a plan to capture the chief. The plan called for the arrest to take place at dawn on December 15, and advised the use of a light spring wagon to facilitate the chief's removal before his followers could rally. Bullhead decided against using the wagon. He intended to have the police officers force Sitting Bull to mount a horse immediately after the arrest.[42] Around 5:30 a.m. on December 15, 39 police officers and four volunteers approached Sitting Bull's house. They surrounded the house, knocked and entered. Bullhead told Sitting Bull that he was under arrest and led him outside.[43] The camp awakened and men converged at the house of their chief. As Bullhead ordered Sitting Bull to mount a horse, he explained that the Indian Affairs agent needed to see him and then he could return to his house. Sitting Bull refused to comply and the police used force on him. The Sioux in the village were enraged. A Sioux known as Catch-the-Bear shouldered his rifle and shot Bullhead who, in return, fired his revolver into the chest of Sitting Bull.[44] Another police officer, Red Tomahawk, shot Sitting Bull in the head, and the chief dropped to the ground. He died between 12 and 1 p.m.[citation needed] A close-quarters fight erupted, and within minutes several men were dead. Six policemen were killed immediately and two more died shortly after the fight. Sitting Bull and seven of his supporters lay dead, along with two horses.[45] Sitting Bull's body was taken to Fort Yates to be placed in a coffin (made by the Army carpenter)[46] and for burial. In 1953 Lakota family members exhumed what they believed to be his remains, to be reinterred near Mobridge, South Dakota, his birthplace.[47][48] Legacy[edit]     Sitting Bull, 1882   Following Sitting Bull's death, his cabin on the Grand River was taken to Chicago to become an exhibit at the 1893 World's Columbian Exposition. Native American dancers also performed at the Exposition.[49] Sitting Bull was the subject of, or a featured character in, several Hollywood motion pictures and documentaries. Among them are:  Sitting Bull: The Hostile Sioux Indian Chief (1914) Sitting Bull at the Spirit Lake Massacre (1927) Annie Get Your Gun (1950) Sitting Bull (1954) Buffalo Bill and the Indians, or Sitting Bull's History Lesson (1976) Into the West (2005) Bury My Heart at Wounded Knee (2007) Sitting Bull: A Stone in My Heart (2008) Documentary [50]  As time passed, Sitting Bull became a symbol and archetype of Native American resistance movements as well as a figure celebrated by his former enemies:  On September 14, 1989, the United States Postal Service released a Great Americans series 28 postage stamp featuring a likeness of Sitting Bull.[51] On March 6, 1996, Standing Rock College was renamed Sitting Bull College in his honor. Sitting Bull College serves as an institution of higher education on Sitting Bull's home of Standing Rock in North Dakota and South Dakota. The American historian Gary Clayton Anderson of the University of Oklahoma published Sitting Bull and the Paradox of Lakota Nationhood a revisionist examination of the Lakota medicine man. Anderson stresses the Little Big Horn not so much as a mishap by Custer but in light of past succeses the Lakota Nation and the merits of Sitting Bull himself.[52] Legoland Billund, the first Legoland park, contains a Lego sculpture of Sitting Bull, the largest sculpture in the park. Sitting Bull is featured as the leader for the Native American Civilization in the computer game Civilization IV.[53] Sitting Bull is lionized as one of 13 great Americans in President Barack Obama's children's book, Of Thee I Sing: A Letter to My Daughters.[54] In August 2010, a research team led by Eske Willerslev, an ancient DNA expert at the University of Copenhagen, announced their intention to sequence the genome of Sitting Bull, with the approval of his descendents using a hair sample obtained during his lifetime.[55]  Gallery[edit]        Sitting Bull's grave at Fort Yates, ca. 1906          Sitting Bull and Buffalo Bill in 1885          Sitting Bull in Pierre, South Dakota on his way to Standing Rock Agency from Fort Randall          Sitting Bull (Tatonka-I-Yatanka), a Hunkpapa Sioux, 1885     See also[edit]  Black Elk Henry Mabb Catherine Weldon  Footnotes[edit]   ^ Encyclopdia Britannica 20. 1955. p.723. ^ New Lakota Dictionary, 2008 ^ Kehoe, Alice (2006).

Parks:  Tokyo Disneyland Tokyo DisneySea Tokyo Disney Forest  Shopping, dining and entertainment complex:  Ikspiari  Resort hotels:  Disney's Ambassador Hotel Tokyo DisneySea Hotel MiraCosta Tokyo Disneyland Hotel  Disneyland Paris[edit] Main article: Disneyland Paris Disneyland Paris, Disney's second resort complex outside the United States, opened on April 12, 1992, as the Euro Disney Resort. Located in Marne-la-Valle in the suburbs of Paris, France, it features two theme parks, a golf course, an entertainment complex and six Disney resort hotels. It is maintained and managed by Euro Disney S.C.A., a company partially owned by The Walt Disney Company whose stock is traded on Euronext. Its properties sit on 4,940 acres (20.0km2), listed below, and are divided into parks, shopping centers, and lodging: Parks:  Disneyland Park Walt Disney Studios Park  Other parks:  Golf Disneyland  Shopping, dining and entertainment complex:  Disney Village  Resort hotels:  Disneyland Paris Hotel Disney's Hotel New York Disney's Newport Bay Club Disney's Sequoia Lodge Disney's Hotel Cheyenne Disney's Hotel Santa Fe Disney's Davy Crockett Ranch  Hong Kong Disneyland Resort[edit] Main article: Hong Kong Disneyland Resort Hong Kong Disneyland Resort, Disney's fifth resort and its second in Asia, opened September 12, 2005. The resort is located in Penny's Bay, Lantau Island, Hong Kong. The resort consists of one theme park and two hotels, with land reserved for future expansion. It is owned and operated by Hong Kong International Theme Parks, an incorporated company jointly owned by The Walt Disney Company and the Government of Hong Kong. The first phase of Hong Kong Disneyland Resort occupies 320 acres (1.3km2). Park:  Hong Kong Disneyland  Other park:  Inspiration Lake Recreation Centre  Resort hotels:  Hong Kong Disneyland Hotel Disney's Hollywood Hotel  Shanghai Disney Resort[edit] Main article: Shanghai Disney Resort In November 2009, Disney received approval from the central government of China to build a Disney theme park in Shanghai's Pudong district. \\\"China is one of the most dynamic, exciting and important countries in the world and this approval marks a very significant milestone for Walt Disney Co in mainland China,\\\" said Robert Iger, president and CEO of Disney.[2] The resort is expected to open in 2015. A groundbreaking ceremony took place on April 7, 2011.[3] Park:  Shanghai Disneyland Park  Disney Cruise Line[edit] Main article: Disney Cruise Line Disney Cruise Line was formed in 1995. Its fleet comprises four ships: Disney Magic (launched 1998), Disney Wonder (1999), Disney Dream (2011), and Disney Fantasy (2012). Each ship was designed and built in collaboration with Walt Disney Imagineering. Disney Cruise Line offers three, four and five-night cruises in the Bahamas; seven-night Alaskan cruises; seven-night Mexican Riviera cruises; and seven-night Caribbean cruises. The Bahamas and Caribbean itineraries include a stop at Disney's private island in the Bahamas, Castaway Cay. In 2012, Disney Cruises will depart from Port Canaveral, Los Angeles, Seattle, Galveston and New York. Fleet:  Disney Magic Disney Wonder Disney Dream Disney Fantasy  Properties:  Castaway Cay  Disney Regional Entertainment[edit] Disney Regional Entertainment was the division of Walt Disney Parks and Resorts which developed and operated unique concepts. It previously operated the Club Disney, DisneyQuest and ESPN Zone concepts. The only remaining DisneyQuest in Downtown Disney at the Walt Disney World Resort is now operated directly by the resort. The only two remaining ESPN Zone restaurants in Los Angeles and Downtown Disney at the Disneyland Resort are operated by third parties. Projects:  ESPN Zone, a chain of sports-themed restaurants. Club Disney, a now-closed chain of children's entertainment centers. DisneyQuest, an indoor arcade with traditional and virtual reality experiences.  Other ventures[edit]  Three World of Disney retail stores managed by the Parks and Resorts merchandise division. Disney Vacation Club, a timeshare program that includes several themed resorts within Disneyland Resort, Walt Disney World Resort, Hong Kong Disneyland Resort plus Disney's Aulani Resort, Disney's Hilton Head Island Resort and Disney's Vero Beach Resort. Adventures by Disney, a program of all-inclusive, guided vacation tour packages offered at predominantly non-Disney sites around the world.  Abandoned concepts[edit] Disney had plans to build Walt Disney's Riverfront Square in St. Louis. In July 1965, Disney cancelled the project. In the 1960s, Disney initiated a plan for a ski resort at Mineral King in California. Opposition from environmental groups led by the Sierra Club led to a temporary court injunction in 1969 and legal battles through the 1970s. The project's planning and scale changed multiple times, and in 1978 Mineral King was annexed into Sequoia National Park, ending any possibility of developing a ski resort.[4] Disney reportedly had plans to build a park named Disney's America. The park was to have been located in Haymarket, Virginia, but local opposition to the idea persuaded Disney to abandon the idea in 1994. On September 28, 1994, Michael Eisner announced that Disney was cancelling its plans to build Disney's America after a bruising national media fight with Protect Historic America and aggressive local opposition in Virginia from Protect Prince William and other citizen groups. Future projects[edit] Asian and European projects[edit] Both Hong Kong Disneyland Resort and Disneyland Paris have room for future expansion.[5] In November 2009, Disney received approval from the Chinese government to build a Disneyland resort in Shanghai's Pudong district.[6] The resort is expected to open in Fall 2015.[3] In early January 2011, conflicting reports emerged regarding Disney's involvement in a proposed entertainment complex in Haifa, Israel, whose plans include a small (30,000 square meter) amusement park scheduled to open in 2013. The project will be partially funded by Shamrock Holdings, a Disney-affiliated investment firm. In the wake of reports from Israeli business newspaper Globes and industry newswire Amusement Management that Disney itself would be involved in the project's development, a spokesperson for Walt Disney Parks and Resorts clarified to Fast Company that Disney did not have any plans to involve itself in the building of the park.[7] Hong Kong Disneyland expansion[edit] Rita Lau, the Secretary for Commerce and Economic Development for Hong Kong, announced that the expansion of Hong Kong Disneyland had been approved by the Executive Council on June 30, 2009, and also approved by the Legislative Council of Hong Kong on July 10, 2009. The park will receive three new lands: Grizzly Gulch, Mystic Point and Toy Story Land. Construction began in late 2009 and will take 5 years to complete. The park will feature a total of seven themed lands after the completion of all the new additions. American projects[edit] Disney has made no announcements regarding plans for another American theme park and CEO Robert Iger frequently has cited international expansion as one of the company's three strategic priorities.[8] In October 2007, Disney announced plans to build a resort at Ko Olina Resort & Marina in Kapolei, Hawaii, featuring both a hotel and Disney Vacation Club timeshare units. The 800-unit property, named Aulani, opened in 2011 and joins the other resorts not associated with a theme park, such as Disney's Hilton Head Island Resort in South Carolina.[9] In September 2011, Walt Disney Parks and Resorts announced plans to partner with filmmaker James Cameron and his Lightstorm Entertainment production company, along with 20th Century Fox, to develop theme park attractions based on Cameron's Avatar film franchise, with the first installation planned for Disney's Animal Kingdom at Walt Disney World, in the form of an Avatar-based section of the park. While no specific plans or attractions were announced, construction on the new area is expected to begin by 2013.[10] Disney also secured exclusive global theme parks rights to the Avatar franchise.[11] Properties outside Disney parks[edit] Due to its acquisitions of Marvel Entertainment in 2009 and Lucasfilm in 2012, some Disney-owned franchises are represented in its competitors' parks. Marvel Super Hero Island, a themed land featuring characters and settings from Marvel Comics, has operated at Universal Orlando Resort's Islands of Adventure park since 1999. A Star Wars-themed section of Legoland California's Miniland USA opened in 2011, with a similar version set to open at Legoland Florida in November of 2012, just weeks after Disney's acquisition of Lucasfilm and the Star Wars franchise.

The fair, the theme of which was \\\"Transportation and Communication: World in Motion - World in Touch\\\", coincided with Vancouver's centennial and was held on the north shore of False Creek. It was the second time that Canada held a World's Fair, the first being Expo 67 in Montreal (during the Canadian Centennial). It was also the third World's Fair to be held in the Pacific Northwest in the last 25 years as of 1986 and as of 2012 it still stands as the latest World's Fair to be held in North America.

After the site closed, it was shipped to England where it was installed at the Alton Towers theme park in 1987.   The logo of three interlocking rings to make the 86 in the logo stood for the three main modes of transportation; land, air, and water. Background[edit] Up until the late 1970s, the 173 acre (0.7km2) site on False Creek, where Expo was staged, was a former CPR rail yard and an industrial wasteland. In 1978, Sam Bawlf (then BC Minister of Recreation and Conservation) proposed an exposition to celebrate Vancouver's Centennial year (1986). The proposal was submitted in June 1979, for a fair that was to be called \\\"Transpo 86.\\\" In 1980, the British Columbia Legislature passed the Transpo 86 Corporation Act, paving the way for the fair. The transportation theme reflected the city's role in connecting Canada by rail, its status as a major port and transportation hub, and the role of transportation in communications. The initial idea was to have ...a modest $80 million transportation exposition that would mark Vancouver's 100th anniversary..[1] It soon blossomed into a full exposition thanks to the help of the Vancouver Exposition Commissioner-General at that time, Patrick Reid. The theme of Transportation and Communication led to the conglomeration of many different exhibits of transportation networks. This included a monorail that glided over the crowds that included a trip to every zone. Other ground transports included a Skytrain, a High Speed Surface Transport from Japan, and a French People Mover. (basically a little boxcar). The transports of the sky was the Gondola, a boxcar hovering high in the air. The water taxis moved along four different ports on the site.[2] The fair was awarded to Vancouver by the Bureau of International Expositions in November 1980. However, once it became clear that the event would be a world exposition, the name was officially changed to \\\"Expo 86\\\" by Ambassador and Commissioner General Patrick Reid in October 1981, and, by the end of the year, Expo 86 Corporation was established as a nonprofit agency responsible in the planning and operation of the fair. Local business tycoon Jim Pattison was appointed as CEO, and would eventually also become the president of the corporation. The chief architect selected was Bruno Freschi, the Creative Director was Ron Woodall, and Bob Smith was responsible for the production and design. Construction started in October 1983, when Elizabeth II, Queen of Canada, started a concrete mixer on the future site of the Canada Pavilion, and offered the \\\"invitation to the world.\\\"[3] But, work was disrupted by labour disputes for 5 months. Still, Expo Centre opened May 2, 1985, as a preview centre for the fair. The fair was originally budgeted for a modest CAN$78 million. However, final expenditures for the expanded event totaled $802 million with a deficit of CAN$311 million.[4] The Fair[edit] Expo '86 was opened by Charles, Prince of Wales, Diana, Princess of Wales, and Prime Minister Brian Mulroney on Friday, May 2, 1986. It featured pavilions from 54 nations and numerous corporations. Expo's participants were given the opportunity to design their own pavilion or opt for the less expensive Expo module. Each module was approximately two-and-a-half stories high and had the floor space equal to a third of a city block. The design was such that any number of the square modules could be placed together in a variety of shapes. The roof design allowed the interior exhibit space to be uninterrupted by pillars. This World's Fair was categorized as a \\\"Class II,\\\" or \\\"specialized exhibition,\\\" reflecting its specific emphases on transportation and communications.

Vanuatu, Western Samoa, and Yugoslavia. Legacy[edit] In all, 22 million people attended the expo and, despite a deficit of $311 million CAD, it was considered a tremendous success. It remains to date the second biggest event in British Columbia history and is viewed by many as the transition of Vancouver from a sleepy provincial backwater to a city with global clout.[citation needed] It marked a strong boost to tourism for the province. Many[who?] have also seen the fair as being at least partially responsible for the re-election of the Social Credit party for its final term as a provincial government. Today, the western half of the site has and is continuing to be developed into parks and high rise condominiums. The eastern portion was used for the annual Molson Indy race, until it was cancelled in late 2004. Future plans call for the eastern third of the site to be developed into parkland and condominiums. The western third of the site is presently owned by the real estate investment firm Concord Pacific, which has its primary shareholder the Hong Kong billionaire Li Ka-Shing. The redevelopment took longer than expected, but is one of the most successful urban developments in Canadian history.[citation needed] The south eastern section of the site just underneath the former Expo Center was redeveloped for use as part the Olympic Village for the 2010 Winter Olympics. After the Olympics, it will also be redeveloped into condos and park land[dated info]. Expo 86 will be remembered for the warm, friendly spirit that existed among the exhibitors, staff, 8000 volunteers and visitors. according to Kim O'Leary[10] It put Vancouver on the map by making it into a major tourist attraction. Many of the buildings that stood in the fair stayed there, including restaurants, clubs, and the important service buildings. State of Expo 86 attractions[edit]     The former Expo 86 monorail, Swiss built Von Roll Seilbahnen AG Mark II, is now installed at Alton Towers in the United Kingdom.   Some of the lasting contributions of Expo 86 to the city of Vancouver include:  SkyTrain - A fully automated elevated advanced rapid transit system. The first line was built intending partially to serve Expo, with construction beginning in the autumn of 1982 and revenue service opening in December 1985. SkyTrain has since become the backbone of the city's metropolitan transit system (metro) and the system has been extended five times, including three minor expansions to the original revenue line Expo Line in 1989, 1990, and 1994 as well as the construction of two additional metro lines Millennium Line and Canada Line in 2001 and 2009, respectfully. Construction of a fourth metro line, the Evergreen Line, to Coquitlam as well as guideway, station, and train retrofitting of the entire Expo Line are underway as of 2012. Today, SkyTrain transports over 350,000 passengers daily. SkyTrain still uses its original 1985-86 Expo fleet of trains (Bombardier/UTDC Mark I) as part of daily revenue service as well as new, modern ones that have additional capacity and more advanced technology (Mark II, Mark III). Expo Centre - Science World - An interactive educational centre with an OMNIMAX cinema. It opened May 2, 1986, as the Expo Centre. Between 1989 and 1990, after much public support, the building was expanded, and in late 1990, it opened to the general public as a science museum, \\\"Science World\\\". In 2005 the name was changed to Science World at Telus World of Science. BC Place Stadium - All-purpose domed sports stadium (primarily for the Vancouver Whitecaps FC & BC Lions), home of the opening of Expo '86. The stadium was also home of the 2010 Winter Olympic Games, Opening and Closing Ceremonies. BC Place opened June 19, 1983. SkyTrain's Stadium-Chinatown Station (then, \\\"Stadium Station\\\") was built for this landmark in 1985, and has since served all major sporting and concert events since 1986. In May 2010, the landmark teflon roof was deflated, and is was replaced with a new retractable roof as well as over all structural upgrades and a complete interior design makeover. BC Place reopened on September 30, 2011 as the world's largest cable supported retractable roof stadium. Canada Place The Canada Government pavilion is now a major downtown convention centre and cruise ship docks. It has seen major use over the years and was expanded to allow for bigger cruise ships to dock in 1999. In 2009, a companion building immediately to the northwest was completed. SkyTrain's terminus Waterfront Station served Canada Place in 1986. A special shuttle train between Waterfront and Stadium Station was used throughout the duration of the fair to get patrons between the Canada Pavilion and main Expo site along False Creek. Plaza of Nations - This space has been used as an outdoor concert venue and public plaza with the surrounding buildings used as office space and nightclubs. Since Expo ended, the glass canopy that was connected to the adjacent office buildings was found unsafe and torn down, while in 2007 it was decided that the office buildings will be demolished. The B.C. Pavilion structure remains, and is now the site of the Edgewater Casino. Once the offices are demolished it will leave Canada Place, the B.C. Pavilion and the Telus World of Science as the only remaining structures from Expo directly left on the Expo site.  After the fair closed many of the attractions were auctioned off to buyers. The dispersed Expo '86 building include:     The McBarge is currently anchored derelict in Burrard Inlet next to an oil refinery       The Pub left is formerly the China Gate Restaurant. The Lighthouse right was formerly a spaceship atop a McDonalds. It is now the Lighthouse Pub in Sechelt BC    Monorail - now located at Alton Towers Theme Park in England McBarge (officially Friendship 500) - a floating McDonald's now essentially abandoned in the waters of Burrard Inlet, Burnaby (locally known as \\\"McDerelict\\\"). It can be seen when riding the West Coast Express. Space Ship McDonalds The Spaceship motif from the restaurant was dismantled and the wings were removed. The remodelled pieces were then shipped to Sechelt and reconstructed as a lighthouse to go atop the Lighthouse Pub. China Gate - donated by the Chinese Government to the City of Vancouver. The landmark was relocated in 1987 to Pender Street in Vancouver's Chinatown. China Gate Cafe was dismantled and moved to Sechelt BC and is now the home to the Lighthouse Pub. World's largest ice hockey stick - now in Duncan, British Columbia at the local hockey rink World's largest Flag Pole - now in Surrey, British Columbia at Flag Motors,[citation needed] Scream Machine roller coaster - now Ninja at Six Flags St. Louis Spirit Catcher sculpture - now installed along the waterfront of Barrie, Ontario Inukshuk - once used at the Northwest Territories Pavilion, it is now used as a landmark on English Bay beach, having been relocated in 1988. It was an inspiration for the official logo for the 2010 Winter Olympics. Site Furniture - all sorts of brightly painted remnants were relocated to the PNE on East Hastings Street, as well as other parks and public areas in Greater Vancouver. Folklife Pavilion - most of the Folklife Pavilion buildings were dismantled into pieces, shipped by barge and reconstructed as the Folklife Village, the main shopping center on Gabriola Island, BC UFO H2O - the water park is now at Mount Layton Hot Springs Resort in Terrace, British Columbia. Dragonboats - the 6 teak wooden boats used to celebrate Hong Kong (pavilion) Day by holding a Dragon Boat racing festival can still be seen today on False Creek and are still raced annually. Expo building modules - Numerous former pavilion structures were disassembled and reconstructed, largely for industrial use throughout the Lower Mainland, and few has survived to 2013. They can be identified by their distinctive peaked corners with exposed tubular girders. They can be found in an Industrial Parks of Delta, British Columbia. Russian Pavilion - The Russian Pavilion had a special roof designed with triangles which allowed for maximum floor space coverage without any beams coming down to support it save for the outside of the building. It was dismantled and relocated now housing machinery at the Kruger_Products paper plant in New Westminster British Columbia. Bench Seating - iconic painted wire grid bench seating, coloured as the different zone colours of the fair, with formed concrete bases and the \\\"86\\\" logo branded into the sides, can be seen at various locales around the Greater Vancouver area, notably along the White Rock beach promenade.  Reunions[edit] A group of former Expo '86 employees conducted a 20th anniversary reunion for Expo participants on May 2, 2006, at the Plaza of Nations site. A group of former BC Pavilion employees celebrated the 20th anniversary of the close of Expo 86 at a reunion [1] on October 13, 2006, at the former Expo Centre (now renamed the Telus World of Science). Scandal[edit] In 1988, the site was sold to the Concord Pacific development corporation for a fraction of the original cost, a move that proved to be extremely controversial. Premier William Vander Zalm and Peter Toigo were accused of influence peddling in the sale.[citation needed] Accidents[edit] While opening the World's Fair, Diana, Princess of Wales briefly fainted onto her husband in a crowded hall in the California Pavilion. She recovered quickly in the washroom, and left half an hour later. Prince Charles later said that her fainting spell was a result of heat and exhaustion. However, the Princess confessed several years later that it was actually caused by not having kept down any food for several days a result of her eating disorder. She was chastised by her husband for not \\\"fainting gracefully behind a door.\\\" On May 9, 1986, 9-year-old Karen Ford of Nanaimo, BC died at the Canadian Pavilion. She was crushed while on a revolving turntable that connected two semi-circular theatres in the pavilion. The revolving table was shut down for some time after the accident, but was put back in service with a number of new safety measures.[11] A ride operator on the looping starship ride was hit by the ride when he crossed in front of it late in the evening at the end of his shift, Most of the bones in his body were broken. It was a on a very busy weekend in September. (a source is needed) In popular media[edit]  The Vancouver-based indie band Said the Whale recorded a song called \\\"False Creek Change\\\" about the changes that Expo 86 brought to the area. The song starts: False Creek changed in '86 / The year Expo exploited her shore / It's been 22 years laying down bricks / There's no room for me here any more.   Death Cab for Cutie, from nearby Bellingham, Washington, also has a song entitled \\\"Expo '86\\\" on their album Transatlanticism.   Scenes from Vancouver (some of the Expo) have appeared in a video edition of the song \\\"If I Had Wings\\\", composed in 1986 by children's singer/songwriter Hap Palmer.   The band Wolf Parade also released an LP entitled Expo 86 in 2010.

He was killed by Indian agency police on the Standing Rock Indian Reservation during an attempt to arrest him at a time when authorities feared that he would join the Ghost Dance movement.[3] Before the Battle of the Little Bighorn, Sitting Bull had a vision in which he saw the defeat of the 7th Cavalry under Lt. Col. George Armstrong Custer on June 25, 1876. Sitting Bull's leadership motivated his people to a major victory. Months after their victory at the battle, Sitting Bull and his group left the United States for Wood Mountain, Saskatchewan, where he remained until 1881, at which time he surrendered to U.S. forces. A small remnant of his band under Chief Wabl  decided to stay at Wood Mountain. After working as a performer, Sitting Bull returned to the Standing Rock Agency in South Dakota. Because of fears that he would use his influence to support the Ghost Dance movement, Indian Service agent James McLaughlin at Fort Yates ordered his arrest. During an ensuing struggle between Sitting Bull's followers and the agency police, Sitting Bull was shot in the side and head by Standing Rock policemen Lieutenant Bull Head (Tatankapah) and Red Tomahawk (Marcelus Chankpidutah) after the police were fired upon by Sitting Bull's supporters. His body was taken to nearby Fort Yates for burial, but in 1953, his remains were possibly exhumed and reburied near Mobridge, South Dakota, by his Lakota family, who wanted his body to be nearer to his birthplace.

Despite being embroiled in the American Civil War, the United States Army retaliated in 1863 and 1864, even against bands which had not been involved in the hostilities.[8] In 1864, two brigades of about 2200 soldiers under Brigadier General Alfred Sully attacked a village. The defenders were led by Sitting Bull, Gall and Inkpaduta.[8] The Sioux were driven out, but skirmishing continued into August.[citation needed] In September, Sitting Bull and about 100 Hunkpapa Sioux came across a small party near what is now Marmarth, North Dakota. They had been left behind by a wagon train commanded by Captain James L. Fisk to effect some repairs to an overturned wagon. When he led an attack, Sitting Bull was shot in the left hip by a soldier.[8] The bullet exited out through the small of his back, and the wound was not too serious.[9] Red Cloud's War[edit] Sitting Bull led numerous war parties against Fort Berthold, Fort Stevenson, and Fort Buford and their environs from 1865 through 1868.[10] Although Red Cloud was a leader of the Oglala Sioux, his leadership and attacks against forts in the Powder River Country of Montana were supported by Sitting Bull's guerrilla attacks on emigrant parties and smaller forts throughout the upper Missouri River region.[citation needed] By early 1868, the U.S. government desired a peaceful settlement to Red Cloud's War. It agreed to Red Cloud's demands that Forts Phil Kearny and C.F. Smith be abandoned. Chief Gall of the Hunkpapas (among other representatives of the Hunkpapas, Blackfeet, and Yankton Sioux) signed a form of the Treaty of Fort Laramie on July 2, 1868 at Fort Rice (near Bismarck, North Dakota).[11] Sitting Bull did not agree to the treaty. He continued his hit-and-run attacks on forts in the upper Missouri area throughout the late 1860s and early 1870s.[12] The events of 1868 mark a historically debated period of Sitting Bull's life. According to historian Stanley Vestal, who conducted interviews with surviving Hunkpapa in 1930, Sitting Bull was made \\\"Supreme Chief of the whole Sioux Nation\\\" at this time. Later historians and ethnologists have refuted this concept of authority, as the Lakota society was highly decentralised. Lakota bands and their elders made individual decisions.[13] The Great Sioux War of 1876[edit] For more details on this topic, see Great Sioux War of 1876.     Early Cabinet card of Sitting Bull, 1881.   Sitting Bull's band of Hunkpapa continued to attack migrating parties and forts in the late 1860s. When in 1871 the Northern Pacific Railway conducted a survey for a route across the northern plains directly through Hunkpapa lands, it encountered stiff Sioux resistance.[14] The same railway people returned the following year accompanied by federal troops. Sitting Bull and the Hunkpapa attacked the survey party, which was forced to turn back.[15] In 1873, the military accompaniment for the surveyors was increased again, but Sitting Bull's forces resisted the survey \\\"most vigorously.\\\"[16] The Panic of 1873 forced the Northern Pacific Railway's backers (such as Jay Cooke) into bankruptcy. This halted construction of the railroad through Sioux territory. After the discovery and new wealth from gold in California, other men became interested in the potential for gold mining in the Black Hills. In 1874, Lt. Col. George Armstrong Custer led a military expedition from Fort Abraham Lincoln near Bismarck, to explore the Black Hills for gold and to determine a suitable location for a military fort in the Hills.[17] Custer's announcement of gold in the Black Hills triggered the Black Hills Gold Rush. Tensions increased between the Sioux and European Americans' seeking to move into the Black Hills.[18] Although Sitting Bull did not attack Custer's expedition in 1874, the US government was increasingly pressured to open the Black Hills to mining and settlement. It was alarmed at reports of Sioux depredations (encouraged by Sitting Bull). In November 1875, the government ordered all Sioux bands outside the Great Sioux Reservation to move onto the reservation, knowing full well that not all would comply. As of February 1, 1876, the Interior Department certified as \\\"hostile\\\" those bands who continued to live off the reservation.[19] This certification allowed the military to pursue Sitting Bull and other Lakota bands as \\\"hostiles\\\". According to the historian Margot Liberty, many Lakota bands allied with the Cheyenne during the Plains Wars because they thought the other nation was under attack by the US. Given this connection, she suggests the major war should have been called \\\"The Great Cheyenne War\\\". Since 1860, the Northern Cheyenne had led several battles among the Plains Indians. Before 1876, the US Army had destroyed seven Cheyenne camps, more than those of any other nation.[20] However, other historians such as Robert M. Utley[21] and Jerome Greene[22][23] also use Lakota oral testimony as the basis for their conclusions that the Lakota coalition, of which Sitting Bull was the ostensible head, was the primary target of the federal government's pacification campaign. Battle of the Little Bighorn[edit] For more details on this topic, see Battle of the Little Bighorn.     Little Bighorn battlefield   During the period 18681876, Sitting Bull developed into the most important of Native American chiefs. After the Treaty of Fort Laramie (1868) and the creation of the Great Sioux Reservation, many traditional Sioux warriors, such as Red Cloud of the Oglala and Spotted Tail of the Brul, moved to reside permanently on the reservations. They were largely dependent for subsistence on the US Indian agencies. Many other chiefs, including members of Sitting Bull's Hunkpapa band such as Gall, at times lived temporarily at the agencies. They needed the supplies at a time when white encroachment and the depletion of buffalo herds reduced their resources and challenged Native American independence.[citation needed] In 1875, the Northern Cheyenne, Hunkpapa, Oglala, Sans Arc, and Minneconjou camped together for a Sun Dance, with both the Cheyenne medicine man White Bull or Ice and Sitting Bull in association. This ceremonial alliance preceded their fighting together in 1876.[20] Sitting Bull had a major revelation.  At the climactic moment, \\\"Sitting Bull intoned, 'The Great Spirit has given our enemies to us. We are to destroy them. We do not know who they are. They may be soldiers.' Ice too observed, 'No one then knew who the enemy were  of what tribe.'...They were soon to find out.\\\"(Utley 1992: 12224)  Sitting Bull's refusal to adopt any dependence on the white man meant that at times he and his small band of warriors lived isolated on the Plains. When Native Americans were threatened by the United States, numerous members from various Sioux bands and other tribes, such as the North Cheyenne, came to Sitting Bull's camp. His reputation for \\\"strong medicine\\\" developed as he continued to evade the European Americans.     Sketch of Sitting Bull; Harper's Weekly, December 8, 1877 issue.   After the January 1st ultimatum of 1876, when the US Army began to track down Sioux and others living off the reservation as hostiles, Native Americans gathered at Sitting Bull's camp. The chief took an active role in encouraging this \\\"unity camp\\\". He sent scouts to the reservations to recruit warriors, and told the Hunkpapa to share supplies with those Native Americans who joined them. An example of his generosity was Sitting Bull's taking care of Wooden Leg's Northern Cheyenne tribe. They had been impoverished by Captain Reynold's March 17, 1876 attack and fled to Sitting Bull's camp for safety.[20] The Hunkpapa chief provided resources to sustain the new recruits. Over the course of the first half of 1876, Sitting Bull's camp continually expanded, as natives joined him for safety in numbers. His leadership had attracted the warriors and families of an extensive village, estimated at more than 10,000 people. Lt. Col. Custer came across this large camp on June 25, 1876. Sitting Bull did not take a direct military role in the ensuing battle; instead he acted as a spiritual chief and had performed the Sun Dance, in which he fasted and sacrificed over 100 pieces of flesh from his arms, a week prior to the attack.[4] Custers 7th Cavalry advance party attacked Cheyenne and Lakota tribes at their camp on the Little Big Horn River (known as the Greasy Grass River to the Lakota) on June 25, 1876. The U.S. Army did not realize how large the camp was. More than 2,000 Native American warriors had left their reservations to follow Sitting Bull. Inspired by a vision of Sitting Bulls, in which he saw U.S. soldiers being killed as they entered the tribes camp, the Cheyenne and Lakota fought back. Custer's badly outnumbered troops lost ground quickly and were forced to retreat. The tribes led a counter-attack against the soldiers on a nearby ridge, ultimately annihilating them.[24] The Native Americans' victory celebrations were short-lived. Public shock and outrage at Custer's death and defeat, and the government's knowledge about the remaining Sioux, led them to assign thousands more soldiers to the area. Over the next year, the new American military forces pursued the Lakota, forcing many of the Native Americans to surrender. Sitting Bull refused to surrender and in May 1877 led his band across the border into Saskatchewan, Canada. He remained in exile for four years near Wood Mountain, refusing a pardon and the chance to return.[25] When crossing the border into Saskatchewan, Sitting Bull was met by the Canadian Mounties of the region. During this meeting, James Morrow Walsh, commander of the North-West Mounted Police, explained to Sitting Bull that the Lakota were now on British soil and must obey British law. Walsh emphasized that he enforced the law equally and that every person in the territory had a right to justice. Walsh became an advocate for Sitting Bull and the two became good friends for the remainder of their lives.[26] Also while in Canada Sitting Bull met with chief Crowfoot, who was a chief of the Blackfeet, long-time powerful enemies of the Lakota and Cheyenne. Sitting Bull wished to make peace with the Blackfeet Nation and Crowfoot. Being an advocate for peace himself, Crowfoot eagerly accepted the tobacco peace offering. Sitting Bull was so impressed by the Blackfeet chief that he named one of his sons after him.[27] Sitting Bull and his men only stayed in Canada for 4 years. Due to the smaller size of the buffalo herds in Canada, Sitting Bull and his men found it difficult to find enough food to feed his people, who were starving and exhausted. Furthermore, due to Sitting Bulls presence in the country, there had been a growth in tension between the Canadian and the United States governments.[28] Before Sitting Bull left Saskatchewan, he may have visited Walsh for a final time and left a ceremonial headdress as a memento.[29] Surrender[edit]     Fort Buford's original 1872 Commanding Officer's Quarters where Sitting Bull's surrender ceremony was held   Hunger and desperation eventually forced Sitting Bull, and 186 of his family and followers to return to the United States and surrender on July 19, 1881. Sitting Bull had his young son Crow Foot surrender his Winchester lever-action carbine to Major David H. Brotherton, commanding officer of Fort Buford in the parlor of the Commanding Officer's Quarters in a ceremony the next day. He told the 4 soldiers, 20 warriors and other guests in the small room, that he wished to regard the soldiers and the white race as friends but he wanted to know who would teach his son the new ways of the world. Two weeks later, after waiting in vain for other members of his tribe to follow him from Canada, the Army transferred Sitting Bull and his band to Fort Yates, the military post located adjacent to the Standing Rock Agency, which straddles the present-day boundary of North and South Dakota.[citation needed] Sitting Bull and his band of 186 people were kept separate from the other Hunkpapa gathered at the agency. Army officials were concerned that the famed chief would stir up trouble among the recently surrendered northern bands. On August 26, 1881, he was visited by the census taker William T. Selwyn, who counted twelve people in the Hunkpapa leader's immediate family. Forty-one families, totaling 195 people, were recorded in Sitting Bull's band.[30] The military decided to transfer him and his band to Fort Randall, to be held as prisoners of war. Loaded onto a steamboat, the band of 172 people was sent down the Missouri River to Fort Randall (near present-day Pickstown, South Dakota on the southern border of the state). There they spent the next 20 months. They were allowed to return north to the Standing Rock Agency in May 1883.[citation needed] Wild West Show participation[edit] In 1885, Sitting Bull was allowed to leave the reservation to go Wild Westing with Buffalo Bill Codys Buffalo Bill's Wild West. He got about $50 a week for riding once around the arena, where he was a popular attraction. Although it is rumored that he cursed his audiences in his native tongue during the show, the historian Utley contends that he did not.[31] Historians have reported that Sitting Bull gave speeches about his desire for education for the young, and reconciling relations between the Sioux and whites.[32] The historian Edward Lazarus wrote that Sitting Bull reportedly cursed his audience in Lakota in 1884, during an opening address celebrating the completion of the Northern Pacific Railway.[33] During his participation with the Wild West show, Sitting Bull met Annie Oakley. He was so impressed with Oakley's skills with firearms that he offered $65 for a photographer to take a photo of the two together.[34] The admiration and respect of was mutual. Oakley stated that Sitting Bull made a \\\"great pet\\\" of her.[35] Over time, Sitting Bull's respect for the young sharpshooter grew. Oakley was quite modest in her attire, deeply respectful of others and had a remarkable stage persona despite being a woman who stood only five feet in height. Sitting Bull felt that she was \\\"gifted\\\" by supernatural means in order to shoot so accurately with both hands. As a result of his esteem, he adopted her as a daughter in 1884. He named her \\\"Little Sure Shot\\\" -- a name that Oakley used throughout her career.[36] Sitting Bull stayed with the show for four months before returning home. During that time, audiences began to consider him a celebrity and a romanticized warrior. He earned a small fortune by charging for his autograph and picture, although he often gave his money away to the homeless and beggars.[37] Conversion[edit] In 1883, rumors floated that Sitting Bull had been baptized into the Catholic Church. James McLaughlin, Indian agent at Standing Rock Agency, dismissed these reports, saying that \\\"The reported baptism of Sitting-Bull is erroneous. There is no immediate prospect of such ceremony so far as I am aware.\\\" [38][39][40] Death and burial[edit]     \\\"Wild scene\\\", \\\"Squaws death chant heard in every direction\\\"       Monument at Sitting Bull's grave, Mobridge, South Dakota, 2003   Sitting Bull returned to the Standing Rock Agency after working in Buffalo Bill's Wild West Show. In 1890, James McLaughlin, the U.S. Indian Agent at Fort Yates on Standing Rock Agency, feared that the Lakota leader was about to flee the reservation with the Ghost Dancers, so he ordered the police to arrest him.[41] On December 14, 1890, McLaughlin drafted a letter to Lt. Henry Bullhead that included instructions and a plan to capture the chief. The plan called for the arrest to take place at dawn on December 15, and advised the use of a light spring wagon to facilitate the chief's removal before his followers could rally. Bullhead decided against using the wagon. He intended to have the police officers force Sitting Bull to mount a horse immediately after the arrest.[42] Around 5:30 a.m. on December 15, 39 police officers and four volunteers approached Sitting Bull's house. They surrounded the house, knocked and entered. Bullhead told Sitting Bull that he was under arrest and led him outside.[43] The camp awakened and men converged at the house of their chief. As Bullhead ordered Sitting Bull to mount a horse, he explained that the Indian Affairs agent needed to see him and then he could return to his house. Sitting Bull refused to comply and the police used force on him. The Sioux in the village were enraged. A Sioux known as Catch-the-Bear shouldered his rifle and shot Bullhead who, in return, fired his revolver into the chest of Sitting Bull.[44] Another police officer, Red Tomahawk, shot Sitting Bull in the head, and the chief dropped to the ground. He died between 12 and 1 p.m.[citation needed] A close-quarters fight erupted, and within minutes several men were dead. Six policemen were killed immediately and two more died shortly after the fight. Sitting Bull and seven of his supporters lay dead, along with two horses.[45] Sitting Bull's body was taken to Fort Yates to be placed in a coffin (made by the Army carpenter)[46] and for burial. In 1953 Lakota family members exhumed what they believed to be his remains, to be reinterred near Mobridge, South Dakota, his birthplace.[47][48] Legacy[edit]     Sitting Bull, 1882   Following Sitting Bull's death, his cabin on the Grand River was taken to Chicago to become an exhibit at the 1893 World's Columbian Exposition. Native American dancers also performed at the Exposition.[49] Sitting Bull was the subject of, or a featured character in, several Hollywood motion pictures and documentaries. Among them are:  Sitting Bull: The Hostile Sioux Indian Chief (1914) Sitting Bull at the Spirit Lake Massacre (1927) Annie Get Your Gun (1950) Sitting Bull (1954) Buffalo Bill and the Indians, or Sitting Bull's History Lesson (1976) Into the West (2005) Bury My Heart at Wounded Knee (2007) Sitting Bull: A Stone in My Heart (2008) Documentary [50]  As time passed, Sitting Bull became a symbol and archetype of Native American resistance movements as well as a figure celebrated by his former enemies:  On September 14, 1989, the United States Postal Service released a Great Americans series 28 postage stamp featuring a likeness of Sitting Bull.[51] On March 6, 1996, Standing Rock College was renamed Sitting Bull College in his honor. Sitting Bull College serves as an institution of higher education on Sitting Bull's home of Standing Rock in North Dakota and South Dakota. The American historian Gary Clayton Anderson of the University of Oklahoma published Sitting Bull and the Paradox of Lakota Nationhood a revisionist examination of the Lakota medicine man. Anderson stresses the Little Big Horn not so much as a mishap by Custer but in light of past succeses the Lakota Nation and the merits of Sitting Bull himself.[52] Legoland Billund, the first Legoland park, contains a Lego sculpture of Sitting Bull, the largest sculpture in the park. Sitting Bull is featured as the leader for the Native American Civilization in the computer game Civilization IV.[53] Sitting Bull is lionized as one of 13 great Americans in President Barack Obama's children's book, Of Thee I Sing: A Letter to My Daughters.[54] In August 2010, a research team led by Eske Willerslev, an ancient DNA expert at the University of Copenhagen, announced their intention to sequence the genome of Sitting Bull, with the approval of his descendents using a hair sample obtained during his lifetime.[55]  Gallery[edit]        Sitting Bull's grave at Fort Yates, ca. 1906          Sitting Bull and Buffalo Bill in 1885          Sitting Bull in Pierre, South Dakota on his way to Standing Rock Agency from Fort Randall          Sitting Bull (Tatonka-I-Yatanka), a Hunkpapa Sioux, 1885     See also[edit]  Black Elk Henry Mabb Catherine Weldon  Footnotes[edit]   ^ Encyclopdia Britannica 20. 1955. p.723. ^ New Lakota Dictionary, 2008 ^ Kehoe, Alice (2006).
