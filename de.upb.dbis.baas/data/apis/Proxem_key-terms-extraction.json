        "body": "Conversational modeling is an important task in\nnatural language understanding and machine intelligence.\nAlthough previous approaches exist, they are often restricted to specific domains\n(e.g., booking an airline ticket) and require handcrafted rules.\nIn this paper, we present a simple approach for this task which uses the recently\nproposed sequence to sequence framework.\nOur model converses by predicting the next sentence\ngiven the previous sentence or sentences in a conversation.\nThe strength of our model is that\nit can be trained end-to-end and thus requires\nmuch fewer hand-crafted rules. We find that this\nstraightforward model can generate simple conversations given a large conversational training\ndataset. Our preliminary suggest that, despite optimizing the wrong objective function, the model\nis able to extract knowledge from both a domain\nspecific dataset, and from a large, noisy, and general domain dataset of movie subtitles. On a\ndomain-specific IT helpdesk dataset, the model\ncan find a solution to a technical problem via\nconversations. On a noisy open-domain movie\ntranscript dataset, the model can perform simple\nforms of common sense reasoning. As expected,\nwe also find that the lack of consistency is a common failure mode of our model.\n1. Introduction\nAdvances in end-to-end training of neural networks have\nled to remarkable progress in many domains such as speech\nrecognition, computer vision, and language processing.\nRecent work suggests that neural networks can do more\nthan just mere classification, they can be used to map complicated structures to other complicated structures. An example of this is the task of mapping a sequence to another\nsequence which has direct applications in natural language\nunderstanding. One of the major\nadvantages of this framework is that it requires little feature engineering and domain specificity whilst matching or surpassing state-of-the-art results. This advance, in our opinion, allows researchers to work on tasks for which domain\nknowledge may not be readily available, or for tasks which\nare simply too hard to model.\nConversational modeling can directly benefit from this formulation because it requires mapping between queries and\nreponses. Due to the complexity of this mapping, conversational modeling has previously been designed to be very\nnarrow in domain, with a major undertaking on feature engineering. In this work, we experiment with the conversation modeling task by casting it to a task of predicting the\nnext sequence given the previous sequence or sequences\nusing recurrent networks.\nWe find that this approach can do surprisingly well on generating\nfluent and accurate replies to conversations.\nWe test the model on chat sessions from an IT helpdesk\ndataset of conversations, and find that the model can sometimes track the problem and provide a useful answer to\nthe user. We also experiment with conversations obtained\nfrom a noisy dataset of movie subtitles, and find that the\nmodel can hold a natural conversation and sometimes perform simple forms of common sense reasoning. In both\ncases, the recurrent nets obtain better perplexity compared\nto the n-gram model and capture important long-range correlations. From a qualitative point of view, our model is\nsometimes able to produce natural conversations.\n\n2. Related Work\nOur approach is based on recent work which proposed to use neural networks to map sequences to sequences. This framework has been\nused for neural machine translation and achieves improvements on the English-French and English-German\ntranslation tasks from the WMT’14 dataset. It has also been used for\nother tasks such as parsing and\nimage captioning . Since it is\nwell known that vanilla RNNs suffer from vanishing gradients, most researchers use variants of the\nLong Short Term Memory (LSTM) recurrent neural network .\nOur work is also inspired by the recent success of neural language modeling, which shows that recurrent neural\nnetworks are rather effective models for natural language.\nMore recently, work by Sordoni et al.\nand Shang et al. , used recurrent neural\nnetworks to model dialogue in short conversations (trained\non Twitter-style chats).\nBuilding bots and conversational agents has been pursued by many researchers over the last decades, and it\nis out of the scope of this paper to provide an exhaustive list of references. However, most of these systems\nrequire a rather complicated processing pipeline of many\nstages. Our work differs from conventional systems by\nproposing an end-to-end approach to the problem which\nlacks domain knowledge. It could, in principle, be combined with other systems to re-score a short-list of candidate responses, but our work is based on producing answers given by a probabilistic model trained to maximize\nthe probability of the answer given some context\n\nOur  approach  makes  use  of  the  sequence  to  sequence\n(\nseq2seq\n) model described in.  The\nmodel is based on a recurrent neural network which reads\nthe  input sequence one token  at  a  time,  and  predicts the\noutput sequence, also one token at a time. During training,\nthe true output sequence is given to the model, so learning\ncan be done by backpropagation.  The model is trained to\nmaximize the cross entropy of the correct sequence given\nits context. During inference, given that the true output sequence is not observed, we simply feed the predicted output\ntoken as input to predict the next output. This is a “greedy”\ninference approach.  A less greedy approach would be to\nuse beam search, and feed several candidates at the previous step to the next step.  The predicted sequence can be\nselected based on the probability of the sequence.",

          "body": "Conversational modeling is an important task in\nnatural language understanding and machine intelligence.\nAlthough previous approaches exist, they are often restricted to specific domains\n(e.g., booking an airline ticket) and require handcrafted rules.\nIn this paper, we present a simple approach for this task which uses the recently\nproposed sequence to sequence framework.\nOur model converses by predicting the next sentence\ngiven the previous sentence or sentences in a conversation.\nThe strength of our model is that\nit can be trained end-to-end and thus requires\nmuch fewer hand-crafted rules. We find that this\nstraightforward model can generate simple conversations given a large conversational training\ndataset. Our preliminary suggest that, despite optimizing the wrong objective function, the model\nis able to extract knowledge from both a domain\nspecific dataset, and from a large, noisy, and general domain dataset of movie subtitles. On a\ndomain-specific IT helpdesk dataset, the model\ncan find a solution to a technical problem via\nconversations. On a noisy open-domain movie\ntranscript dataset, the model can perform simple\nforms of common sense reasoning. As expected,\nwe also find that the lack of consistency is a common failure mode of our model.\n1. Introduction\nAdvances in end-to-end training of neural networks have\nled to remarkable progress in many domains such as speech\nrecognition, computer vision, and language processing.\nRecent work suggests that neural networks can do more\nthan just mere classification, they can be used to map complicated structures to other complicated structures. An example of this is the task of mapping a sequence to another\nsequence which has direct applications in natural language\nunderstanding. One of the major\nadvantages of this framework is that it requires little feature engineering and domain specificity whilst matching or surpassing state-of-the-art results. This advance, in our opinion, allows researchers to work on tasks for which domain\nknowledge may not be readily available, or for tasks which\nare simply too hard to model.\nConversational modeling can directly benefit from this formulation because it requires mapping between queries and\nreponses. Due to the complexity of this mapping, conversational modeling has previously been designed to be very\nnarrow in domain, with a major undertaking on feature engineering. In this work, we experiment with the conversation modeling task by casting it to a task of predicting the\nnext sequence given the previous sequence or sequences\nusing recurrent networks.\nWe find that this approach can do surprisingly well on generating\nfluent and accurate replies to conversations.\nWe test the model on chat sessions from an IT helpdesk\ndataset of conversations, and find that the model can sometimes track the problem and provide a useful answer to\nthe user. We also experiment with conversations obtained\nfrom a noisy dataset of movie subtitles, and find that the\nmodel can hold a natural conversation and sometimes perform simple forms of common sense reasoning. In both\ncases, the recurrent nets obtain better perplexity compared\nto the n-gram model and capture important long-range correlations. From a qualitative point of view, our model is\nsometimes able to produce natural conversations.\n\n2. Related Work\nOur approach is based on recent work which proposed to use neural networks to map sequences to sequences. This framework has been\nused for neural machine translation and achieves improvements on the English-French and English-German\ntranslation tasks from the WMT’14 dataset. It has also been used for\nother tasks such as parsing and\nimage captioning . Since it is\nwell known that vanilla RNNs suffer from vanishing gradients, most researchers use variants of the\nLong Short Term Memory (LSTM) recurrent neural network .\nOur work is also inspired by the recent success of neural language modeling, which shows that recurrent neural\nnetworks are rather effective models for natural language.\nMore recently, work by Sordoni et al.\nand Shang et al. , used recurrent neural\nnetworks to model dialogue in short conversations (trained\non Twitter-style chats).\nBuilding bots and conversational agents has been pursued by many researchers over the last decades, and it\nis out of the scope of this paper to provide an exhaustive list of references. However, most of these systems\nrequire a rather complicated processing pipeline of many\nstages. Our work differs from conventional systems by\nproposing an end-to-end approach to the problem which\nlacks domain knowledge. It could, in principle, be combined with other systems to re-score a short-list of candidate responses, but our work is based on producing answers given by a probabilistic model trained to maximize\nthe probability of the answer given some context\n\nOur  approach  makes  use  of  the  sequence  to  sequence\n(\nseq2seq\n) model described in.  The\nmodel is based on a recurrent neural network which reads\nthe  input sequence one token  at  a  time,  and  predicts the\noutput sequence, also one token at a time. During training,\nthe true output sequence is given to the model, so learning\ncan be done by backpropagation.  The model is trained to\nmaximize the cross entropy of the correct sequence given\nits context. During inference, given that the true output sequence is not observed, we simply feed the predicted output\ntoken as input to predict the next output. This is a “greedy”\ninference approach.  A less greedy approach would be to\nuse beam search, and feed several candidates at the previous step to the next step.  The predicted sequence can be\nselected based on the probability of the sequence.",

          "body": "Conversational modeling is an important task in\nnatural language understanding and machine intelligence.\nAlthough previous approaches exist, they are often restricted to specific domains\n(e.g., booking an airline ticket) and require handcrafted rules.\nIn this paper, we present a simple approach for this task which uses the recently\nproposed sequence to sequence framework.\nOur model converses by predicting the next sentence\ngiven the previous sentence or sentences in a conversation.\nThe strength of our model is that\nit can be trained end-to-end and thus requires\nmuch fewer hand-crafted rules. We find that this\nstraightforward model can generate simple conversations given a large conversational training\ndataset. Our preliminary suggest that, despite optimizing the wrong objective function, the model\nis able to extract knowledge from both a domain\nspecific dataset, and from a large, noisy, and general domain dataset of movie subtitles. On a\ndomain-specific IT helpdesk dataset, the model\ncan find a solution to a technical problem via\nconversations. On a noisy open-domain movie\ntranscript dataset, the model can perform simple\nforms of common sense reasoning. As expected,\nwe also find that the lack of consistency is a common failure mode of our model.\n1. Introduction\nAdvances in end-to-end training of neural networks have\nled to remarkable progress in many domains such as speech\nrecognition, computer vision, and language processing.\nRecent work suggests that neural networks can do more\nthan just mere classification, they can be used to map complicated structures to other complicated structures. An example of this is the task of mapping a sequence to another\nsequence which has direct applications in natural language\nunderstanding. One of the major\nadvantages of this framework is that it requires little feature engineering and domain specificity whilst matching or surpassing state-of-the-art results. This advance, in our opinion, allows researchers to work on tasks for which domain\nknowledge may not be readily available, or for tasks which\nare simply too hard to model.\nConversational modeling can directly benefit from this formulation because it requires mapping between queries and\nreponses. Due to the complexity of this mapping, conversational modeling has previously been designed to be very\nnarrow in domain, with a major undertaking on feature engineering. In this work, we experiment with the conversation modeling task by casting it to a task of predicting the\nnext sequence given the previous sequence or sequences\nusing recurrent networks.\nWe find that this approach can do surprisingly well on generating\nfluent and accurate replies to conversations.\nWe test the model on chat sessions from an IT helpdesk\ndataset of conversations, and find that the model can sometimes track the problem and provide a useful answer to\nthe user. We also experiment with conversations obtained\nfrom a noisy dataset of movie subtitles, and find that the\nmodel can hold a natural conversation and sometimes perform simple forms of common sense reasoning. In both\ncases, the recurrent nets obtain better perplexity compared\nto the n-gram model and capture important long-range correlations. From a qualitative point of view, our model is\nsometimes able to produce natural conversations.\n\n2. Related Work\nOur approach is based on recent work which proposed to use neural networks to map sequences to sequences. This framework has been\nused for neural machine translation and achieves improvements on the English-French and English-German\ntranslation tasks from the WMT’14 dataset. It has also been used for\nother tasks such as parsing and\nimage captioning . Since it is\nwell known that vanilla RNNs suffer from vanishing gradients, most researchers use variants of the\nLong Short Term Memory (LSTM) recurrent neural network .\nOur work is also inspired by the recent success of neural language modeling, which shows that recurrent neural\nnetworks are rather effective models for natural language.\nMore recently, work by Sordoni et al.\nand Shang et al. , used recurrent neural\nnetworks to model dialogue in short conversations (trained\non Twitter-style chats).\nBuilding bots and conversational agents has been pursued by many researchers over the last decades, and it\nis out of the scope of this paper to provide an exhaustive list of references. However, most of these systems\nrequire a rather complicated processing pipeline of many\nstages. Our work differs from conventional systems by\nproposing an end-to-end approach to the problem which\nlacks domain knowledge. It could, in principle, be combined with other systems to re-score a short-list of candidate responses, but our work is based on producing answers given by a probabilistic model trained to maximize\nthe probability of the answer given some context\n\nOur  approach  makes  use  of  the  sequence  to  sequence\n(\nseq2seq\n) model described in.  The\nmodel is based on a recurrent neural network which reads\nthe  input sequence one token  at  a  time,  and  predicts the\noutput sequence, also one token at a time. During training,\nthe true output sequence is given to the model, so learning\ncan be done by backpropagation.  The model is trained to\nmaximize the cross entropy of the correct sequence given\nits context. During inference, given that the true output sequence is not observed, we simply feed the predicted output\ntoken as input to predict the next output. This is a “greedy”\ninference approach.  A less greedy approach would be to\nuse beam search, and feed several candidates at the previous step to the next step.  The predicted sequence can be\nselected based on the probability of the sequence.",
