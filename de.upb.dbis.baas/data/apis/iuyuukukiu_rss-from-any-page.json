Services to the Belgian capital will also face similar disruption next Monday.\r\n        Workers were stopped from entering some industrial areas by pickets, while schools and public services in Belgium were also disrupted.\r\n        The public sector movement began early last month with 100,000 people taking part in a march in Brussels that ended in clashes leaving 112 police injured.\r\n        Several vehicles were set alight by protesters who also hurled stones and flares at police. About 50 people were hurt and 30 detained, officials said.\r\n        Unions are opposing a decision by Charles Michel's centre-right coalition government to scrap a cost-of-living wage rise next year. They are also protesting against public sector cutbacks and plans to increase the retirement age.\r\n        Mr Michel was sworn in as prime minister in October. The 38-year-old French-speaking liberal is Belgium's youngest leader since 1841. \r\n  \n\n\t</description><guid isPermaLink=\"true\">http://www.bbc.com/news/business-30378351</guid><pubDate>Mon, 08 Dec 2014 14:22:30 GMT</pubDate></item><item><title>BBC News - Clashes at Greek protests to mark police shooting</title><link>http://www.bbc.com/news/world-europe-30363054</link><description>\n    \t\t  \r\n    6 December 2014\r\nLast updated at 16:53 ET\r\n\t  \r\n\r\n\r\n\t\r\n  Share this page\r\n  \r\n      Delicious\r\n    \r\n    \r\n      Digg\r\n    \r\n    \r\n      Facebook\r\n    \r\n    \r\n      reddit\r\n    \r\n    \r\n      StumbleUpon\r\n    \r\n    \r\n      Twitter\r\n    \r\n    \r\n      Email\r\n    \r\n    \r\n      Print\r\n    \r\n  \r\n &amp;#13;\n&amp;lt;!--&amp;#13;\n$render(\"page-bookmark-links\",\"page-bookmark-links-head\",{&amp;#13;\n    useForgeShareTools:\"true\",&amp;#13;\n    position:\"top\",&amp;#13;\n    site:'News', &amp;#13;\n    headline:'BBC News - Clashes at Greek protests to mark police shooting', &amp;#13;\n    storyId:'30363054', &amp;#13;\n    sectionId:'99123', &amp;#13;\n    url:'http://www.bbc.com/news/world-europe-30363054', &amp;#13;\n    edition:'US'&amp;#13;\n}); &amp;#13;\n--&amp;gt;&amp;#13;\nClashes at Greek protests to mark police shooting\r\n\r\n     \r\n         \r\n \n    \n    \n\t\t\n        \r\n  Protesters clashed with riot police on Saturday night\r\n  \r\n\t\r\n\t\tContinue reading the main story\t\tRelated Stories\r\n\t\t\r\n\tGreek protests mark teenage death\r\n\r\n\t\t\r\n\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\t\r\n\r\n\r\n\t\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\tMurder verdict in Greek riot case\r\n\r\n\t\t\r\n\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\t\r\n\r\n\r\n\t\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\tRelief at Greece police verdict\r\n\r\n\t\t\r\n\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\r\n                      Clashes have erupted in the capital of Greece during protests marking six years since police shot dead an unarmed teenager.\r\n        At least 5,000 demonstrators marched in Athens on Saturday. Some attacked shops and hurled petrol bombs at riot police.\r\n        Police officers used tear gas and a water cannon to disperse protesters.\r\n        The demonstrators had been marking the anniversary of 15-year-old Alexis Grigoropoulos' death. He was shot by an officer who has since been jailed.\r\n        Mr Grigoropoulos' killing on 6 December 2008 sparked violent riots across Greece, with cars being set alight and shops looted in a number of cities.\r\n        Clashes have also broken out on previous anniversaries of his death.\r\n        On Saturday, anti-establishment protesters attacked banks and damaged shops and bus stops. \r\n  \r\n  Petrol bombs were thrown at police, who responded with tear gas and water canon\r\n  \r\n\r\n  Earlier on Saturday, thousands marched in a rally marking Alexis Grigoropoulos' death\r\n  \r\n      At one point, demonstrators looted a clothes shop and set fire to the merchandise in the street, the Associated Press news agency reported.\r\n        According to Reuters, police said they detained close to 100 protesters.\r\n        Clashes primarily took place in Athen's Exarchia neighbourhood, but violence was also reported in Thessaloniki, in northern Greece.\r\n        No injuries were reported in either city.\r\n        Protesters have also been expressing support for Nikos Romanos, a friend of Mr Grigoropoulos who witnessed his death.\r\n        Romanos, 21, has been jailed for attempted bank robbery. He is currently on hunger strike, demanding study leave after he was accepted onto a university course.\r\n  \n\n\t</description><guid isPermaLink=\"true\">http://www.bbc.com/news/world-europe-30363054</guid><pubDate>Mon, 08 Dec 2014 14:18:51 GMT</pubDate></item></channel></rss>",

About 50 people were hurt and 30 detained, officials said.\r\n        Unions are opposing a decision by Charles Michel's centre-right coalition government to scrap a cost-of-living wage rise next year. They are also protesting against public sector cutbacks and plans to increase the retirement age.\r\n        Mr Michel was sworn in as prime minister in October.

Some attacked shops and hurled petrol bombs at riot police.\r\n        Police officers used tear gas and a water cannon to disperse protesters.\r\n        The demonstrators had been marking the anniversary of 15-year-old Alexis Grigoropoulos' death. He was shot by an officer who has since been jailed.\r\n        Mr Grigoropoulos' killing on 6 December 2008 sparked violent riots across Greece, with cars being set alight and shops looted in a number of cities.\r\n        Clashes have also broken out on previous anniversaries of his death.\r\n        On Saturday, anti-establishment protesters attacked banks and damaged shops and bus stops. \r\n  \r\n  Petrol bombs were thrown at police, who responded with tear gas and water canon\r\n  \r\n\r\n  Earlier on Saturday, thousands marched in a rally marking Alexis Grigoropoulos' death\r\n  \r\n      At one point, demonstrators looted a clothes shop and set fire to the merchandise in the street, the Associated Press news agency reported.\r\n        According to Reuters, police said they detained close to 100 protesters.\r\n        Clashes primarily took place in Athen's Exarchia neighbourhood, but violence was also reported in Thessaloniki, in northern Greece.\r\n        No injuries were reported in either city.\r\n        Protesters have also been expressing support for Nikos Romanos, a friend of Mr Grigoropoulos who witnessed his death.\r\n        Romanos, 21, has been jailed for attempted bank robbery. He is currently on hunger strike, demanding study leave after he was accepted onto a university course.\r\n  \n\n\t</description><guid isPermaLink=\"true\">http://www.bbc.com/news/world-europe-30363054</guid><pubDate>Mon, 08 Dec 2014 14:18:51 GMT</pubDate></item></channel></rss>",
