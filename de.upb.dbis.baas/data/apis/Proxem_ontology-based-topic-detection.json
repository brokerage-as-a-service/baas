        "body": "{ \"documents\": [\n \"David Cameron has offered voters a fresh wave of election promises, including 30 hours a week of free childcare for working families and scrapping tax on the minimum wage, in the Conservative party manifesto for “buccaneering Britain”.\n\nThe prime minister’s pledges, which also include the right to buy housing association properties, appear designed to appeal to lower-income swing voters in the key seats that the Conservatives need to hold in the election.\n\nCameron also repeated the Conservative party’s “ambition” to bring down immigration from the hundreds of thousands to the tens of thousands, despite the clear failure of the party to meet this target over the last five years.\n\nLaunching the manifesto at a technical college in Swindon, Cameron began by repeating his claim that the Conservatives were now “the party of working people”.\n\nHis manifesto was presented as a “plan for every stage of your life”, with promises aimed at voters of all ages.\n\nDuring the speech, Cameron tried to address criticism that he had failed during his premiership to show vision or articulate what he believes in.\n\nThe prime minister said he did not enter politics to be an accountant who balances the books but to create a country “where children can make the most of their God-given talents whatever their background … That is why I am here.”\n\nIn an upbeat address, he described Britain as “buccaneering”, promising “a good life” for families, before adding: “I am above all a patriot … I love my country with all my heart. That’s why five years ago, almost to the day, I stood on a stage like this asking you to give me and this party five years to save our country from ruin. And it’s why I stand on this stage and ask you for five more years to finish the job.”\n\nCameron said he was doubling the amount of free childcare for three- and four-year-olds to 30 hours a week, saving parents up to £5,000 a year. This exceeds Labour’s offer of 25 hours a week.\n\nRegarding personal finances, he said there would be a new law to ensure no one earning the minimum wage paid income tax.\",\n\n\"The heads of thousands of businesses, who collectively employ nearly 100,000 people, have signed a letter in support of the Conservatives.\n\nThe letter, published by the Daily Telegraph and organised by the Tories’ small business ambassador Karren Brady, warns that putting Ed Miliband and the Labour party into office on 7 May would be “far too risky” for Britain’s economy.\n\nThe document, which is signed by bosses from around 5,000 companies, follows a similar letter from more than 100 leading business executives.\n\nIn response to that, Labour sought to portray the Tories as a party that has the interests of major corporations at heart. But the Conservatives will produce Monday’s letter as evidence that they are, in fact, the party of small and medium sized firms.\nElection 2015 interactive: who is ahead in the polls where you live?\nRead more\n\nThe letter read: “We run small businesses right across the country. We work hard, make sacrifices and invest our own money to help our businesses grow and succeed.\n\n“It was tough during the recession, but we kept going. This Conservative-led government has been genuinely committed to making sure Britain is open for business.\n\n“They’ve managed to get the economy moving again by tackling the deficit, helping to keep interest rates low and inflation down.\n\n“We’ve been helped by their steps to lower taxes, reduce red tape, simplify employment law and get the banks lending.\n\n“We would like to see David Cameron and George Osborne given the chance to finish what they have started.\n\n“A change now would be far too risky and would undo all the good work of the last five years.”\n\nIt emerged earlier this month that Brady, who is a Tory peer, was trying to convince small businesses to sign the letter in a posting on the party’s website.\n\nThe appeal appeared on a members’ section of the site under the headline “Please sign our business letter”.\n\nOne of the signatories was Glenn Cooper, the managing director of a firm based in north west England that makes bollards.\n\n“To keep our exports rising, we need people in government who understand and appreciate enterprise, and who will back exporters whether they are looking to sell abroad for the first time or are closing their hundredth deal,” he told the Telegraph.\n\n“Right now, as far as I have seen, there’s only one party which fits that description – the Conservatives.”\n\nBrady’s drive came after claims the Tories were resorting to desperate measures when aides working for the health secretary asked doctors to sign a letter saying that the NHS should not be used for a political football.\n\nThey did so after more than 140 top doctors wrote a letter to the Guardian accusing the coalition government of weakening the nation’s health service with cuts to funding.\n\"\n]}",

In the standard case, the text to process is written in various languages. To establish systems that support a wide scale of languages and formats is one of the mission of our Research team.\n\nAnother goal of ours is to develop cross-lingual algorithms, that is algorithms which take as input texts in different languages and output an information computed on all those texts. For example on a task called sentiment analysis, which consists in detecting the \"polarity\" of a document (\"is this document rather positive or negative?\"), we want to implement a unique algorithm that would take as input sentences in English, Chinese, Spanish, etc and would compute a score. There are multiple reasons for us to aim at this. One is for simplicity sake. Indeed, we do not want to implement as many algorithms as languages we may have to handle. Another reason for that choice is that we want to leverage the important amount of available data for some languages to improve the accuracy on languages where data is rare.",

In the standard case, the text to process is written in various languages. To establish systems that support a wide scale of languages and formats is one of the mission of our Research team.\n\nAnother goal of ours is to develop cross-lingual algorithms, that is algorithms which take as input texts in different languages and output an information computed on all those texts. For example on a task called sentiment analysis, which consists in detecting the \"polarity\" of a document (\"is this document rather positive or negative?\"), we want to implement a unique algorithm that would take as input sentences in English, Chinese, Spanish, etc and would compute a score. There are multiple reasons for us to aim at this. One is for simplicity sake. Indeed, we do not want to implement as many algorithms as languages we may have to handle. Another reason for that choice is that we want to leverage the important amount of available data for some languages to improve the accuracy on languages where data is rare.",

          "body": "{ \"documents\": [\n \"David Cameron has offered voters a fresh wave of election promises, including 30 hours a week of free childcare for working families and scrapping tax on the minimum wage, in the Conservative party manifesto for “buccaneering Britain”.\n\nThe prime minister’s pledges, which also include the right to buy housing association properties, appear designed to appeal to lower-income swing voters in the key seats that the Conservatives need to hold in the election.\n\nCameron also repeated the Conservative party’s “ambition” to bring down immigration from the hundreds of thousands to the tens of thousands, despite the clear failure of the party to meet this target over the last five years.\n\nLaunching the manifesto at a technical college in Swindon, Cameron began by repeating his claim that the Conservatives were now “the party of working people”.\n\nHis manifesto was presented as a “plan for every stage of your life”, with promises aimed at voters of all ages.\n\nDuring the speech, Cameron tried to address criticism that he had failed during his premiership to show vision or articulate what he believes in.\n\nThe prime minister said he did not enter politics to be an accountant who balances the books but to create a country “where children can make the most of their God-given talents whatever their background … That is why I am here.”\n\nIn an upbeat address, he described Britain as “buccaneering”, promising “a good life” for families, before adding: “I am above all a patriot … I love my country with all my heart. That’s why five years ago, almost to the day, I stood on a stage like this asking you to give me and this party five years to save our country from ruin. And it’s why I stand on this stage and ask you for five more years to finish the job.”\n\nCameron said he was doubling the amount of free childcare for three- and four-year-olds to 30 hours a week, saving parents up to £5,000 a year. This exceeds Labour’s offer of 25 hours a week.\n\nRegarding personal finances, he said there would be a new law to ensure no one earning the minimum wage paid income tax.\",\n\n\"The heads of thousands of businesses, who collectively employ nearly 100,000 people, have signed a letter in support of the Conservatives.\n\nThe letter, published by the Daily Telegraph and organised by the Tories’ small business ambassador Karren Brady, warns that putting Ed Miliband and the Labour party into office on 7 May would be “far too risky” for Britain’s economy.\n\nThe document, which is signed by bosses from around 5,000 companies, follows a similar letter from more than 100 leading business executives.\n\nIn response to that, Labour sought to portray the Tories as a party that has the interests of major corporations at heart. But the Conservatives will produce Monday’s letter as evidence that they are, in fact, the party of small and medium sized firms.\nElection 2015 interactive: who is ahead in the polls where you live?\nRead more\n\nThe letter read: “We run small businesses right across the country. We work hard, make sacrifices and invest our own money to help our businesses grow and succeed.\n\n“It was tough during the recession, but we kept going. This Conservative-led government has been genuinely committed to making sure Britain is open for business.\n\n“They’ve managed to get the economy moving again by tackling the deficit, helping to keep interest rates low and inflation down.\n\n“We’ve been helped by their steps to lower taxes, reduce red tape, simplify employment law and get the banks lending.\n\n“We would like to see David Cameron and George Osborne given the chance to finish what they have started.\n\n“A change now would be far too risky and would undo all the good work of the last five years.”\n\nIt emerged earlier this month that Brady, who is a Tory peer, was trying to convince small businesses to sign the letter in a posting on the party’s website.\n\nThe appeal appeared on a members’ section of the site under the headline “Please sign our business letter”.\n\nOne of the signatories was Glenn Cooper, the managing director of a firm based in north west England that makes bollards.\n\n“To keep our exports rising, we need people in government who understand and appreciate enterprise, and who will back exporters whether they are looking to sell abroad for the first time or are closing their hundredth deal,” he told the Telegraph.\n\n“Right now, as far as I have seen, there’s only one party which fits that description – the Conservatives.”\n\nBrady’s drive came after claims the Tories were resorting to desperate measures when aides working for the health secretary asked doctors to sign a letter saying that the NHS should not be used for a political football.\n\nThey did so after more than 140 top doctors wrote a letter to the Guardian accusing the coalition government of weakening the nation’s health service with cuts to funding.\n\"\n]}",
