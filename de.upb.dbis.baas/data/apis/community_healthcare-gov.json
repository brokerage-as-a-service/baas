You'll learn if you qualify for <a href=\\\"/will-i-qualify-to-save-on-out-of-pocket-costs\\\">lower out-of-pocket costs</a>. You'll see all the health plans available in your area so you can compare them side-by-side and pick the plan that's right for you.</p>\\n\\n<p>The Marketplace will also tell you if you qualify for free or low-cost coverage available through <a href=\\\"/do-i-qualify-for-medicaid\\\">Medicaid</a> or the <a href=\\\"/are-my-children-eligible-for-chip\\\">Children's Health Insurance Program (CHIP)</a>.</p>\\n\\n<p>Most Americans are eligible to use the Marketplace. Learn more about <a href=\\\"/am-i-eligible-for-coverage-in-the-marketplace/\\\">Marketplace eligibility</a>.</p>\\n\\n<p>The Health Insurance Marketplace is sometimes known as the health insurance \\\"exchange.\\\"</p>\\n\\n<h2>Apply online, by phone, or in person</h2>\\n\\n<p>You can apply for Marketplace coverage several ways: online, by phone, or in person with the help of a Navigator or other qualified helper. Telephone help and online chat are available 24/7.</p>\\n\\n<p>Ready to apply? <a href=\\\"/how-do-i-apply-for-marketplace-coverage\\\">There are several ways you can apply for coverage</a>.</p>\\n\\n<p>Open enrollment ends March 31, 2014.</p>\\n\\n<h2>What Marketplace plans cover</h2>\\n\\n<p>Insurance plans in the Marketplace are offered by private companies. They all cover the same <a href=\\\"/what-does-marketplace-health-insurance-cover\\\">essential health benefits</a>. No plan can turn you away or charge you more because you have an illness or medical condition. They must cover treatments for these conditions. Plans can't charge women more than men for the same plan. Many <a href=\\\"/what-are-my-preventive-care-benefits/\\\">preventive services</a> are covered at no cost to you.</p>\\n\\n<h2>Find the Marketplace in your state</h2>\\n\\n<p>While all insurance plans are offered by private companies, the Marketplace is run by either your state or the federal government. <strong>Find the Marketplace in your state by using the menu at the bottom of this page.</strong> If your state runs its Marketplace, you'll use your state’s website, not this one.</p>\\n\\n<h2>Before you apply, preview plans and prices</h2>\\n\\n<p>Before you fill out a Marketplace application, you can preview <a href=\\\"/find-premium-estimates/\\\">plans and prices</a> available in your area. Premium quotes shown reflect any lower costs you're eligible for based on your income and household size.</p>\\n\\n<p><strong>Questions? Call 1-800-318-2596, 24 hours a day, 7 days a week.

You'll learn if you qualify for <a href=\\\"/will-i-qualify-to-save-on-out-of-pocket-costs\\\">lower out-of-pocket costs</a>. You'll see all the health plans available in your area so you can compare them side-by-side and pick the plan that's right for you.</p>\\n\\n<p>The Marketplace will also tell you if you qualify for free or low-cost coverage available through <a href=\\\"/do-i-qualify-for-medicaid\\\">Medicaid</a> or the <a href=\\\"/are-my-children-eligible-for-chip\\\">Children's Health Insurance Program (CHIP)</a>.</p>\\n\\n<p>Most Americans are eligible to use the Marketplace. Learn more about <a href=\\\"/am-i-eligible-for-coverage-in-the-marketplace/\\\">Marketplace eligibility</a>.</p>\\n\\n<p>The Health Insurance Marketplace is sometimes known as the health insurance \\\"exchange.\\\"</p>\\n\\n<h2>Apply online, by phone, or in person</h2>\\n\\n<p>You can apply for Marketplace coverage several ways: online, by phone, or in person with the help of a Navigator or other qualified helper. Telephone help and online chat are available 24/7.</p>\\n\\n<p>Ready to apply? <a href=\\\"/how-do-i-apply-for-marketplace-coverage\\\">There are several ways you can apply for coverage</a>.</p>\\n\\n<p>Open enrollment ends March 31, 2014.</p>\\n\\n<h2>What Marketplace plans cover</h2>\\n\\n<p>Insurance plans in the Marketplace are offered by private companies. They all cover the same <a href=\\\"/what-does-marketplace-health-insurance-cover\\\">essential health benefits</a>. No plan can turn you away or charge you more because you have an illness or medical condition. They must cover treatments for these conditions. Plans can't charge women more than men for the same plan. Many <a href=\\\"/what-are-my-preventive-care-benefits/\\\">preventive services</a> are covered at no cost to you.</p>\\n\\n<h2>Find the Marketplace in your state</h2>\\n\\n<p>While all insurance plans are offered by private companies, the Marketplace is run by either your state or the federal government. <strong>Find the Marketplace in your state by using the menu at the bottom of this page.</strong> If your state runs its Marketplace, you'll use your state’s website, not this one.</p>\\n\\n<h2>Before you apply, preview plans and prices</h2>\\n\\n<p>Before you fill out a Marketplace application, you can preview <a href=\\\"/find-premium-estimates/\\\">plans and prices</a> available in your area. Premium quotes shown reflect any lower costs you're eligible for based on your income and household size.</p>\\n\\n<p><strong>Questions? Call 1-800-318-2596, 24 hours a day, 7 days a week.
