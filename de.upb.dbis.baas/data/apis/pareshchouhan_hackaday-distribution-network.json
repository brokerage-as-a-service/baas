The most glaring departure from the old days: the Explorer kit does not require soldering. The PCB is drilled with oversized holes for machine screws and nuts, and component leads are simply wound around the screws and torqued down. A handy method, perhaps, and accessible to electronics newbies, but hardly suitable for delicate component leads. Indeed, [Spritle] reports several over-torqued screws pinching off component leads almost to the point of not having enough lead left to make a connection. Imagine the frustration of destroying a component and not being able to complete the build.</p>\\n<figure id=\\\"attachment_181579\\\" style=\\\"width: 367px\\\" class=\\\"wp-caption alignleft\\\"><img class=\\\"wp-image-181579 size-medium\\\" src=\\\"https://hackadaycom.files.wordpress.com/2015/12/img_20151130_162543-e1449621477954.jpg?w=357&#038;h=400\\\" alt=\\\"Nice retro look, but is it retro quality?\\\" width=\\\"357\\\" height=\\\"400\\\" /><figcaption class=\\\"wp-caption-text\\\">Nice retro look, but is it retro quality?</figcaption></figure>\\n<p>[Spritle] also reports some disturbing errors with the manual for this kit. Heathkit was famed for the quality of their assembly instructions, and their manuals were the &#8220;holy of holies&#8221; in your project. Nothing else was to be touched before you read the manual, which guided you through the assembly process in exquisite detail. But this manual leaves out instructions for installing one resistor, and gets the color code wrong for another one. Having parts left over on a classic Heathkit project would be an indication that you did something very wrong; a builder not as observant as [Spritle] might have had a very confusing time trying to trace that error. And expecting an electronics newbie, which seems to be the target market for this kit, to catch a color code error is hard to take. Yes, attention to detail is an important skill for the budding electronics hobbyist, but why throw curveballs before the hitter knows how to hold the bat?</p>\\n<p>Personally, I don&#8217;t recall any non-solder kits in the Heathkit catalogs of yore; in fact I recall the instruction manuals having extensive soldering lessons in case your iron handling skills were not quite up to snuff. My first kit, an <a href=\\\"http://www.ohio.edu/people/postr/bapix/SW-717.htm\\\" target=\\\"_blank\\\">SW-717 shortwave receiver</a>, was recommended by my neighbor, a ham trying to get my 11-year-old self into amateur radio. He drilled me on soldering skills for hours before we ever broke open the parts envelopes, and it paid off, both for that build and in the long run with a life skill that I&#8217;m still proud of to this day.</p>\\n<p>Looking back on my first build, it seems like the most valuable part of it was that mentorship. Knowing that I had someone to guide me and answer my questions was incredibly helpful. I&#8217;d love to be on the other side of that mentoring relationship today with my kids, and the Heathkit of old would be a fantastic way to do it. I&#8217;d pay a lot of money to bust open a new Heathkit project with my kids. But a no-solder kit? What&#8217;s the point?</p>\\n<p>I&#8217;m not saying that there&#8217;s no place for a no-solder experience as a &#8220;gateway drug&#8221; to more complicated kits. But the choice of this kit as the first offering is puzzling; it begs the question of where Heathkit sees the company going from here. The price point is baffling too &#8211; $150USD for a battery-powered AM radio with no speaker. Yes, it looks nice, but I&#8217;m not willing to pay a premium for that.</p>\\n<p>Where Heathkit goes from here is anybody&#8217;s guess. Our own [Brian Benchoff] has been keeping close tabs on the <a href=\\\"https://hackaday.com/2015/10/08/heathkit-live-die-repeat/\\\">on again, off again Heathkit reboot</a>, and earlier <a href=\\\"https://hackaday.com/2014/12/22/the-heathkit-mystery/\\\">announcements of a Heathkit return</a> that included a reddit AMA and a bizarre geocache promotion.

So he&#8217;s just exactly the guy you&#8217;d tap to write a paper on <a href=\\\"http://arxiv.org/pdf/1511.09054v1.pdf\\\" target=\\\"_blank\\\">the financial repercussions of the destruction of the Death Stars in Star Wars (PDF)</a>. Wait, what?</p>\\n<p>The central argument of the paper is that, since the Empire has so much money wrapped up in building the Death Stars, it&#8217;s economic suicide for the Rebels to destroy it. To quantify any of this, [Feinstein] runs financial crisis models. The idea is that the Rebels win, but they inherit an economy that&#8217;s so dysfunctional that they&#8217;d have been better off not destroying the Death Stars.</p>\\n<p>We&#8217;re not saying that the rest of the <a href=\\\"http://www.nbcnews.com/pop-culture/movies/star-wars-destroying-death-star-would-trigger-economic-crisis-n472631?cid=par-time_20151202\\\" target=\\\"_blank\\\">press is gullible</a>, but we are saying that they&#8217;re <a href=\\\"http://news.nationalpost.com/arts/movies/blowing-up-the-death-star-in-star-wars-would-have-cost-more-than-500-quintillion-and-crippled-the-galaxy\\\" target=\\\"_blank\\\">not putting their best economists onto articles about financing Death Stars</a>. But here at Hackaday, we are. And we&#8217;re calling it a hoax. So let&#8217;s look into what the paper gets right, and what makes less sense even than Chewbacca&#8217;s infernal growling. Spoiler: we&#8217;ll get wrapped up in numbers because it&#8217;s fun, but the whole thing is moot for Econ 101-style reasons.</p>\\n<p><span id=\\\"more-182444\\\"></span></p>\\n<h3 id=\\\"the-numbers\\\">The Numbers</h3>\\n<p>[Feinstein] has no numbers for anything, basically. More specifically, he&#8217;s got one: an estimate of the amount of steel it took to build the first Death Star (DS1). And he got this figure from the experts, the United States government.</p>\\n<p><a href=\\\"https://hackadaycom.files.wordpress.com/2015/12/d1-14mar-jedi-km1.jpg\\\" rel=\\\"attachment wp-att-182446\\\" target=\\\"_blank\\\"><img class=\\\"alignright size-medium wp-image-182446\\\" src=\\\"https://hackadaycom.files.wordpress.com/2015/12/d1-14mar-jedi-km1.jpg?w=400&#038;h=300\\\" alt=\\\"d1-14mar-jedi-km1\\\" width=\\\"400\\\" height=\\\"300\\\" /></a>The White House opened up a general-purpose online petition website, and predictably the Internet responded with nearly 40,000 signatures to build a Death Star by 2016. In a brilliant PR move, White House got [Paul Shawcross], Chief of the Science and Space Branch at the Office of Management and Budget <a href=\\\"https://petitions.whitehouse.gov/response/isnt-petition-response-youre-looking\\\" target=\\\"_blank\\\">to write a cheeky response</a>. And [Paul] did what any of us would do &#8212; he typed &#8220;cost of Death Star&#8221; into a search engine and reported what he found: $852 quadrillion. Good enough for government work, right?</p>\\n<p>But the White House got its figures from <a href=\\\"http://www.centives.net/S/2012/how-much-would-it-cost-to-build-the-death-star/\\\" target=\\\"_blank\\\">this website</a> which admits, after much public scrutiny that followed getting picked up by the White House, to have gotten the math wrong by a factor of one hundred! We&#8217;re looking at much more like $8.1 quadrillion. But we&#8217;re quibbling. What&#8217;s a factor of one hundred when the numbers are all made up, top to bottom?</p>\\n<p>Anyway, the absolute value doesn&#8217;t matter as much as the ratio of the cost of the Death Stars to the Empire&#8217;s Gross Galactic Product (GGP). [Feinstein] estimates this by taking the ratio of the cost of the Manhattan Project to the US GDP at the time, which is around 0.21%.</p>\\n<p>We think this is probably an underestimate. The US <a href=\\\"http://data.worldbank.org/indicator/MS.MIL.XPND.GD.ZS\\\" target=\\\"_blank\\\">spends about 4% of GDP on defense <em>per year</em> the last four years</a>, when we weren&#8217;t even facing the existential crisis of a hot war with a Rebel Alliance. For comparison, during WWII, the US spent around 50% of GDP per year on the war effort.</p>\\n<p>The Manhattan Project was also largely a research affair, at least in comparison to building a space station the size of a small planet. We&#8217;d be totally happy to say that the Empire spent 0.2% on Death-Star-related R&amp;D. But we&#8217;ve got to figure something more like 5% or 10% of GGP for as central and apparently ambitious a project as a Death Star. (We do love that [Feinstein] concedes that they could re-use a lot of that R&amp;D expenditure on the second Death Star &#8212; it looks just the same!)</p>\\n<p>So the numbers are all over the place, but if anything [Feinstein] certainly underestimates the importance of the Death Star to the Empire.</p>\\n<h3 id=\\\"banking-the-consequences\\\">Banking: The Consequences</h3>\\n<p>So what happens when the Empire collapses? The banks that they owe money to go bankrupt, and can&#8217;t loan to normal Wookies anymore, and the economy grinds to a halt. Preventing this requires providing the banks with (temporary) liquidity &#8212; bailing them out &#8212; to prevent much larger system-wide harm.</p>\\n<p>[Feinstein] is an expert in modeling financial crises, so we&#8217;re not going to get into those issues except to note that his models are grossly mis-calibrated, not the least due to the easy tenfold underestimate of the cost of the Death Star in terms of GGP. Anyway, he predicts galactic economic chaos.</p>\\n<p><a href=\\\"https://hackadaycom.files.wordpress.com/2015/12/var.png\\\" rel=\\\"attachment wp-att-182451\\\" target=\\\"_blank\\\"><img class=\\\"alignleft wp-image-182451 size-medium\\\" src=\\\"https://hackadaycom.files.wordpress.com/2015/12/var.png?w=400&#038;h=300\\\" alt=\\\"var\\\" width=\\\"400\\\" height=\\\"300\\\" /></a>But there&#8217;s economic chaos and there&#8217;s economic chaos. [Feinstein], a former banker at Lehman Brothers, is no Rebel. He&#8217;s set the 10% <a href=\\\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Value_at_risk\\\" target=\\\"_blank\\\">value-at-risk</a> at 1% of GGP. That is, he&#8217;s saying that the Rebels are trying to limit risk of bank default so thoroughly that a 1% GGP loss would only occur in the worst 10% of scenarios. And to do this, the Rebels would have to budget for a one-time bail out the banks to the tune of up 20% of GGP.</p>\\n<figure id=\\\"attachment_182447\\\" style=\\\"width: 156px\\\" class=\\\"wp-caption alignright\\\"><a href=\\\"https://hackadaycom.files.wordpress.com/2015/12/feinstein_faculty_bio_72.jpg\\\" rel=\\\"attachment wp-att-182447\\\" target=\\\"_blank\\\"><img class=\\\"wp-image-182447 size-thumbnail\\\" src=\\\"https://hackadaycom.files.wordpress.com/2015/12/feinstein_faculty_bio_72.jpg?w=146&#038;h=150\\\" alt=\\\"Feinstein_faculty_bio_72\\\" width=\\\"146\\\" height=\\\"150\\\" /></a><figcaption class=\\\"wp-caption-text\\\">Rebel? Or Financial Engineer?</figcaption></figure>\\n<p>Han &#8220;Never tell me the odds&#8221; Solo would laugh at this almost insurance-salesmanlike aversion to risk! Does a smuggler and Rebel give a Jar-Jar-Binks about an unlikely 1% GGP bank default? No sir. Han would rather see the curves for 5% GGP losses, or more. And given the way the areas under probability curves tail off, Han&#8217;s bailout is likely to be a <em>lot</em> cheaper than [Feinstein]&#8217;s. Bravery pays!</p>\\n<h3 id=\\\"its-all-moot-sunk-costs\\\">It&#8217;s All Moot: Sunk Costs</h3>\\n<p>But all this is crazy talk, and we don&#8217;t just mean because all this Star Wars stuff is made up. No, we mean there&#8217;s a fundamental flaw in the argument that the Rebels shouldn&#8217;t attack the Death Stars for economic reasons, and it&#8217;s Econ 101: <a href=\\\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sunk_costs\\\" target=\\\"_blank\\\">sunk costs</a>.</p>\\n<p><a href=\\\"https://hackadaycom.files.wordpress.com/2015/12/yoda_empire_strikes_back.png\\\" rel=\\\"attachment wp-att-182449\\\" target=\\\"_blank\\\"><img class=\\\"alignleft wp-image-182449 size-full\\\" src=\\\"https://hackadaycom.files.wordpress.com/2015/12/yoda_empire_strikes_back.png?w=800\\\" alt=\\\"Yoda_Empire_Strikes_Back\\\"   /></a>To see why, imagine that the Rebels sent in their Jedis and got rid of Palatine and Vader the old-fashioned way, through assassination. No Death Stars destroyed, no collateral damage, but a clean capitulation of the Empire and victory for the Rebels. Hooray, economic collapse averted? Not so fast!</p>\\n<p>The Rebels surely aren&#8217;t going to fund further work on the Death Star &#8212; it&#8217;s not their style. So what are they going to do with it? Renovate and build condos? In that neighborhood? The money wasted on the Death Stars is already wasted, and it&#8217;s not going to be undone. Our guess? The Rebels will just have to demolish it anyway, because you don&#8217;t want an un-powered Death Star falling out of orbit and crashing into the forest moon of Endor.</p>\\n<p>But failing to destroy a Death Star just because it was expensive, even though you have no use for it, is a mistake for young Jedi. As a wise, green professor of mine once said, &#8220;Your choices on decision-relevant criteria based must be!&#8221;</p>\\n<h3 id=\\\"conclusion\\\">Conclusion</h3>\\n<p>This was ridiculous. Hope you had fun. And learned about sunk costs.</p><br />Filed under: <a href=\\\"http://feeds.wordpress.com/1.0/gocomments/hackadaycom.wordpress.com/182444/\\\"href='https://hackaday.com/category/featured/'>Featured</a>  <a rel=\\\"nofollow\\\"  target=\\\"_blank\\\"><img alt=\\\"\\\" border=\\\"0\\\" src=\\\"http://feeds.wordpress.com/1.0/comments/hackadaycom.wordpress.com/182444/\\\" /></a> <img alt=\\\"\\\" border=\\\"0\\\" src=\\\"https://pixel.wp.com/b.gif?host=hackaday.com&#038;blog=4779443&#038;post=182444&#038;subd=hackadaycom&#038;ref=&#038;feed=1\\\" width=\\\"1\\\" height=\\\"1\\\" />\",\"commentRssFeed\":\"https://hackaday.com/2015/12/17/a-scam-of-galactic-proportions/feed/\",\"mediaThumbnail\":\"https://hackadaycom.files.wordpress.com/2015/12/palpatine.jpg?w=150\",\"isOnFrontPage\":true,\"__v\":0,\"mediaContent\":[{\"url\":\"https://hackadaycom.files.wordpress.com/2015/12/palpatine.jpg?w=150\",\"title\":\"Palpatine\",\"_id\":\"5672cf1291eb30fa1e7db079\"},{\"url\":\"https://2.gravatar.com/avatar/89126ee7bae680f1d6d109c79fe970a0?s=96&d=https%3A%2F%2F2.gravatar.com%2Favatar%2Fad516503a11cd5ca435acc9bb6523536%3Fs%3D96\",\"title\":\"hexagon5un\",\"_id\":\"5672cf1291eb30fa1e7db078\"},{\"url\":\"https://hackadaycom.files.wordpress.com/2015/12/d1-14mar-jedi-km1.jpg?w=400\",\"title\":\"d1-14mar-jedi-km1\",\"_id\":\"5672cf1291eb30fa1e7db077\"},{\"url\":\"https://hackadaycom.files.wordpress.com/2015/12/var.png?w=400\",\"title\":\"var\",\"_id\":\"5672cf1291eb30fa1e7db076\"},{\"url\":\"https://hackadaycom.files.wordpress.com/2015/12/feinstein_faculty_bio_72.jpg?w=146\",\"title\":\"Feinstein_faculty_bio_72\",\"_id\":\"5672cf1291eb30fa1e7db075\"},{\"url\":\"https://hackadaycom.files.wordpress.com/2015/12/yoda_empire_strikes_back.png\",\"title\":\"Yoda_Empire_Strikes_Back\",\"_id\":\"5672cf1291eb30fa1e7db074\"}],\"categories\":[\"Featured\",\"bankruptcy\",\"crash\",\"death star\",\"financial markets\",\"star wars\"]},{\"_id\":\"5672a73891eb30fa1e7daef0\",\"guid\":\"181791\",\"title\":\"Gutted USB Power Packs run Your TV\",\"link\":\"https://hackaday.com/2015/12/17/gutted-usb-power-packs-run-your-tv/\",\"comments\":\"https://hackaday.com/2015/12/17/gutted-usb-power-packs-run-your-tv/#respond\",\"pubDate\":\"Thu, 17 Dec 2015 12:01:08 +0000\",\"pubTimeStamp\":\"2015-12-17T17:01:08.000Z\",\"creator\":\"Dan Maloney\",\"guidLink\":\"http://hackaday.com/?p=181791\",\"description\":\"<p>With a computer in every pocket, being tethered to large mains-powered appliances is a bit passe.

All the hardware was had on the cheap from an outfit called <a href=\\\"http://www.cdrking.com/?mod=products&amp;type=list\\\" target=\\\"_blank\\\">Cd-r King</a>, a Phillipines-based discount gadgetorium we&#8217;d like to see in the states. He got a handful of USB power packs and harvested the single 18650 battery from each, whipped up a quick battery holder from 1/2&#8243; PVC pipe and some bolts to connect the inverter. With four batteries in series he was able to run a flat-screen TV with ease, as well as a large floor fan &#8211; say, is that a <a href=\\\"https://hackaday.com/2014/12/08/the-last-week-of-the-mooltipass-approacheth/\\\">Mooltipass</a> on [Stephen]&#8217;s shelf in the background?

Two fresh AAs will run a tad above 3V, but as they discharge, or if he&#8217;s using rechargeables, there just won&#8217;t be enough potential.

The converter is important because the controller disables the DC/DC converter during sleep mode to conserve battery life. The PIC16LF1703 will run down to 1.8V and is miserly on power consumption, especially in sleep mode.</p>\\n<p>The LED driver takes SPI commands from the PIC and turns the LEDs on. The software on the PIC uses a state machine architecture to drive the animations you can see in the videos below.</p>\\n<p>The project documentation is impressive and includes a high-level overview of the software and the hardware.

There are equations and variables to calculate, possibly some empirical measurements by measuring the resistance of a trace, but Ohm&#8217;s Law is a law for a reason. If you do things right, you can make a PCB heat bed perfectly suited for the task. You can even design in safety features like overcurrent protection and fuses. It can&#8217;t be that hard. After all, your house is full of devices that are plugged into the wall.</p>\\n<p>However, there&#8217;s a reason we use 12V and 24V heated beds &#8211; they give us, at the very least, the illusion of safety. Therefore, [Makertum] is looking for a few comments from specialists and people who know what they&#8217;re doing.</p>\\n<p>Although a mains powered heated bed sounds scary for a hobbyist-built 3D printer, there are a number of positives to the design. It would heat up faster, thin down a few parts, and significantly reduce the overall cost of the printer by not requiring another 100 Watts delivered from a 12V power supply. It&#8217;s a great idea if it doesn&#8217;t burn down the house.

The most glaring departure from the old days: the Explorer kit does not require soldering. The PCB is drilled with oversized holes for machine screws and nuts, and component leads are simply wound around the screws and torqued down. A handy method, perhaps, and accessible to electronics newbies, but hardly suitable for delicate component leads. Indeed, [Spritle] reports several over-torqued screws pinching off component leads almost to the point of not having enough lead left to make a connection. Imagine the frustration of destroying a component and not being able to complete the build.</p>\\n<figure id=\\\"attachment_181579\\\" style=\\\"width: 367px\\\" class=\\\"wp-caption alignleft\\\"><img class=\\\"wp-image-181579 size-medium\\\" src=\\\"https://hackadaycom.files.wordpress.com/2015/12/img_20151130_162543-e1449621477954.jpg?w=357&#038;h=400\\\" alt=\\\"Nice retro look, but is it retro quality?\\\" width=\\\"357\\\" height=\\\"400\\\" /><figcaption class=\\\"wp-caption-text\\\">Nice retro look, but is it retro quality?</figcaption></figure>\\n<p>[Spritle] also reports some disturbing errors with the manual for this kit. Heathkit was famed for the quality of their assembly instructions, and their manuals were the &#8220;holy of holies&#8221; in your project. Nothing else was to be touched before you read the manual, which guided you through the assembly process in exquisite detail. But this manual leaves out instructions for installing one resistor, and gets the color code wrong for another one. Having parts left over on a classic Heathkit project would be an indication that you did something very wrong; a builder not as observant as [Spritle] might have had a very confusing time trying to trace that error. And expecting an electronics newbie, which seems to be the target market for this kit, to catch a color code error is hard to take. Yes, attention to detail is an important skill for the budding electronics hobbyist, but why throw curveballs before the hitter knows how to hold the bat?</p>\\n<p>Personally, I don&#8217;t recall any non-solder kits in the Heathkit catalogs of yore; in fact I recall the instruction manuals having extensive soldering lessons in case your iron handling skills were not quite up to snuff. My first kit, an <a href=\\\"http://www.ohio.edu/people/postr/bapix/SW-717.htm\\\" target=\\\"_blank\\\">SW-717 shortwave receiver</a>, was recommended by my neighbor, a ham trying to get my 11-year-old self into amateur radio. He drilled me on soldering skills for hours before we ever broke open the parts envelopes, and it paid off, both for that build and in the long run with a life skill that I&#8217;m still proud of to this day.</p>\\n<p>Looking back on my first build, it seems like the most valuable part of it was that mentorship. Knowing that I had someone to guide me and answer my questions was incredibly helpful. I&#8217;d love to be on the other side of that mentoring relationship today with my kids, and the Heathkit of old would be a fantastic way to do it. I&#8217;d pay a lot of money to bust open a new Heathkit project with my kids. But a no-solder kit? What&#8217;s the point?</p>\\n<p>I&#8217;m not saying that there&#8217;s no place for a no-solder experience as a &#8220;gateway drug&#8221; to more complicated kits. But the choice of this kit as the first offering is puzzling; it begs the question of where Heathkit sees the company going from here. The price point is baffling too &#8211; $150USD for a battery-powered AM radio with no speaker. Yes, it looks nice, but I&#8217;m not willing to pay a premium for that.</p>\\n<p>Where Heathkit goes from here is anybody&#8217;s guess. Our own [Brian Benchoff] has been keeping close tabs on the <a href=\\\"https://hackaday.com/2015/10/08/heathkit-live-die-repeat/\\\">on again, off again Heathkit reboot</a>, and earlier <a href=\\\"https://hackaday.com/2014/12/22/the-heathkit-mystery/\\\">announcements of a Heathkit return</a> that included a reddit AMA and a bizarre geocache promotion. We really hope that Heathkit makes a comeback, but for now, all we can do is watch and wait. And practice soldering with the kids.</p><br />Filed under: <a href=\\\"http://feeds.wordpress.com/1.0/gocomments/hackadaycom.wordpress.com/180896/\\\"href='https://hackaday.com/category/news/'>news</a>, <a href='https://hackaday.com/category/rants/'>rants</a>  <a rel=\\\"nofollow\\\"  target=\\\"_blank\\\"><img alt=\\\"\\\" border=\\\"0\\\" src=\\\"http://feeds.wordpress.com/1.0/comments/hackadaycom.wordpress.com/180896/\\\" /></a> <img alt=\\\"\\\" border=\\\"0\\\" src=\\\"https://pixel.wp.com/b.gif?host=hackaday.com&#038;blog=4779443&#038;post=180896&#038;subd=hackadaycom&#038;ref=&#038;feed=1\\\" width=\\\"1\\\" height=\\\"1\\\" />\",\"commentRssFeed\":\"https://hackaday.com/2015/12/17/heathkits-triumphant-return/feed/\",\"mediaThumbnail\":\"https://hackadaycom.files.wordpress.com/2015/12/heathkit.jpg?w=150\",\"isOnFrontPage\":true,\"__v\":0,\"mediaContent\":[{\"url\":\"https://hackadaycom.files.wordpress.com/2015/12/heathkit.jpg?w=150\",\"title\":\"Heathkit\",\"_id\":\"5672e42b91eb30fa1e7db16a\"},{\"url\":\"https://1.gravatar.com/avatar/d421f7e52f5be289d90d01e5ab9d65bd?s=96&d=https%3A%2F%2F1.gravatar.com%2Favatar%2Fad516503a11cd5ca435acc9bb6523536%3Fs%3D96\",\"title\":\"dpsm64\",\"_id\":\"5672e42b91eb30fa1e7db169\"},{\"url\":\"https://hackadaycom.files.wordpress.com/2015/12/img_20151202_1703502.jpg?w=400\",\"title\":\"img_20151202_170350\",\"_id\":\"5672e42b91eb30fa1e7db168\"},{\"url\":\"https://hackadaycom.files.wordpress.com/2015/12/img_20151130_162543-e1449621477954.jpg?w=357\",\"title\":\"Nice retro look, but is it retro quality?\",\"_id\":\"5672e42b91eb30fa1e7db167\"}],\"categories\":[\"news\",\"rants\",\"AM Explorer\",\"am radio\",\"diy\",\"heathkit\",\"kit\",\"solder\",\"solderless\",\"SW-717\",\"TRF\"]},{\"_id\":\"5672cf1291eb30fa1e7db073\",\"guid\":\"182444\",\"title\":\"A Scam of Galactic Proportions\",\"link\":\"https://hackaday.com/2015/12/17/a-scam-of-galactic-proportions/\",\"comments\":\"https://hackaday.com/2015/12/17/a-scam-of-galactic-proportions/#respond\",\"pubDate\":\"Thu, 17 Dec 2015 15:01:38 +0000\",\"pubTimeStamp\":\"2015-12-17T20:01:38.000Z\",\"creator\":\"Elliot Williams\",\"guidLink\":\"http://hackaday.com/?p=182444\",\"description\":\"<p>Here at Hackaday we see a lot of technological hoaxes looking for funding.

Some are on Kickstarter, others are firms looking for investors. And unlike a lot of the press, we&#8217;re both skeptical and experienced enough to smell the snake oil. When you read about a laser-powered razor blade that looks too good to be true, you know we&#8217;ve got your back.</p>\\n<p>The background: [Zachary Feinstein] is a professor at Washington University in St. Louis who studies financial engineering, and in particular systemic financial risk in the banking sectors. So he&#8217;s just exactly the guy you&#8217;d tap to write a paper on <a href=\\\"http://arxiv.org/pdf/1511.09054v1.pdf\\\" target=\\\"_blank\\\">the financial repercussions of the destruction of the Death Stars in Star Wars (PDF)</a>. Wait, what?</p>\\n<p>The central argument of the paper is that, since the Empire has so much money wrapped up in building the Death Stars, it&#8217;s economic suicide for the Rebels to destroy it. To quantify any of this, [Feinstein] runs financial crisis models. The idea is that the Rebels win, but they inherit an economy that&#8217;s so dysfunctional that they&#8217;d have been better off not destroying the Death Stars.</p>\\n<p>We&#8217;re not saying that the rest of the <a href=\\\"http://www.nbcnews.com/pop-culture/movies/star-wars-destroying-death-star-would-trigger-economic-crisis-n472631?cid=par-time_20151202\\\" target=\\\"_blank\\\">press is gullible</a>, but we are saying that they&#8217;re <a href=\\\"http://news.nationalpost.com/arts/movies/blowing-up-the-death-star-in-star-wars-would-have-cost-more-than-500-quintillion-and-crippled-the-galaxy\\\" target=\\\"_blank\\\">not putting their best economists onto articles about financing Death Stars</a>. But here at Hackaday, we are. And we&#8217;re calling it a hoax. So let&#8217;s look into what the paper gets right, and what makes less sense even than Chewbacca&#8217;s infernal growling. Spoiler: we&#8217;ll get wrapped up in numbers because it&#8217;s fun, but the whole thing is moot for Econ 101-style reasons.</p>\\n<p><span id=\\\"more-182444\\\"></span></p>\\n<h3 id=\\\"the-numbers\\\">The Numbers</h3>\\n<p>[Feinstein] has no numbers for anything, basically. More specifically, he&#8217;s got one: an estimate of the amount of steel it took to build the first Death Star (DS1). And he got this figure from the experts, the United States government.</p>\\n<p><a href=\\\"https://hackadaycom.files.wordpress.com/2015/12/d1-14mar-jedi-km1.jpg\\\" rel=\\\"attachment wp-att-182446\\\" target=\\\"_blank\\\"><img class=\\\"alignright size-medium wp-image-182446\\\" src=\\\"https://hackadaycom.files.wordpress.com/2015/12/d1-14mar-jedi-km1.jpg?w=400&#038;h=300\\\" alt=\\\"d1-14mar-jedi-km1\\\" width=\\\"400\\\" height=\\\"300\\\" /></a>The White House opened up a general-purpose online petition website, and predictably the Internet responded with nearly 40,000 signatures to build a Death Star by 2016. In a brilliant PR move, White House got [Paul Shawcross], Chief of the Science and Space Branch at the Office of Management and Budget <a href=\\\"https://petitions.whitehouse.gov/response/isnt-petition-response-youre-looking\\\" target=\\\"_blank\\\">to write a cheeky response</a>. And [Paul] did what any of us would do &#8212; he typed &#8220;cost of Death Star&#8221; into a search engine and reported what he found: $852 quadrillion. Good enough for government work, right?</p>\\n<p>But the White House got its figures from <a href=\\\"http://www.centives.net/S/2012/how-much-would-it-cost-to-build-the-death-star/\\\" target=\\\"_blank\\\">this website</a> which admits, after much public scrutiny that followed getting picked up by the White House, to have gotten the math wrong by a factor of one hundred! We&#8217;re looking at much more like $8.1 quadrillion. But we&#8217;re quibbling. What&#8217;s a factor of one hundred when the numbers are all made up, top to bottom?</p>\\n<p>Anyway, the absolute value doesn&#8217;t matter as much as the ratio of the cost of the Death Stars to the Empire&#8217;s Gross Galactic Product (GGP). [Feinstein] estimates this by taking the ratio of the cost of the Manhattan Project to the US GDP at the time, which is around 0.21%.</p>\\n<p>We think this is probably an underestimate. The US <a href=\\\"http://data.worldbank.org/indicator/MS.MIL.XPND.GD.ZS\\\" target=\\\"_blank\\\">spends about 4% of GDP on defense <em>per year</em> the last four years</a>, when we weren&#8217;t even facing the existential crisis of a hot war with a Rebel Alliance. For comparison, during WWII, the US spent around 50% of GDP per year on the war effort.</p>\\n<p>The Manhattan Project was also largely a research affair, at least in comparison to building a space station the size of a small planet. We&#8217;d be totally happy to say that the Empire spent 0.2% on Death-Star-related R&amp;D. But we&#8217;ve got to figure something more like 5% or 10% of GGP for as central and apparently ambitious a project as a Death Star. (We do love that [Feinstein] concedes that they could re-use a lot of that R&amp;D expenditure on the second Death Star &#8212; it looks just the same!)</p>\\n<p>So the numbers are all over the place, but if anything [Feinstein] certainly underestimates the importance of the Death Star to the Empire.</p>\\n<h3 id=\\\"banking-the-consequences\\\">Banking: The Consequences</h3>\\n<p>So what happens when the Empire collapses? The banks that they owe money to go bankrupt, and can&#8217;t loan to normal Wookies anymore, and the economy grinds to a halt. Preventing this requires providing the banks with (temporary) liquidity &#8212; bailing them out &#8212; to prevent much larger system-wide harm.</p>\\n<p>[Feinstein] is an expert in modeling financial crises, so we&#8217;re not going to get into those issues except to note that his models are grossly mis-calibrated, not the least due to the easy tenfold underestimate of the cost of the Death Star in terms of GGP. Anyway, he predicts galactic economic chaos.</p>\\n<p><a href=\\\"https://hackadaycom.files.wordpress.com/2015/12/var.png\\\" rel=\\\"attachment wp-att-182451\\\" target=\\\"_blank\\\"><img class=\\\"alignleft wp-image-182451 size-medium\\\" src=\\\"https://hackadaycom.files.wordpress.com/2015/12/var.png?w=400&#038;h=300\\\" alt=\\\"var\\\" width=\\\"400\\\" height=\\\"300\\\" /></a>But there&#8217;s economic chaos and there&#8217;s economic chaos. [Feinstein], a former banker at Lehman Brothers, is no Rebel. He&#8217;s set the 10% <a href=\\\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Value_at_risk\\\" target=\\\"_blank\\\">value-at-risk</a> at 1% of GGP. That is, he&#8217;s saying that the Rebels are trying to limit risk of bank default so thoroughly that a 1% GGP loss would only occur in the worst 10% of scenarios. And to do this, the Rebels would have to budget for a one-time bail out the banks to the tune of up 20% of GGP.</p>\\n<figure id=\\\"attachment_182447\\\" style=\\\"width: 156px\\\" class=\\\"wp-caption alignright\\\"><a href=\\\"https://hackadaycom.files.wordpress.com/2015/12/feinstein_faculty_bio_72.jpg\\\" rel=\\\"attachment wp-att-182447\\\" target=\\\"_blank\\\"><img class=\\\"wp-image-182447 size-thumbnail\\\" src=\\\"https://hackadaycom.files.wordpress.com/2015/12/feinstein_faculty_bio_72.jpg?w=146&#038;h=150\\\" alt=\\\"Feinstein_faculty_bio_72\\\" width=\\\"146\\\" height=\\\"150\\\" /></a><figcaption class=\\\"wp-caption-text\\\">Rebel? Or Financial Engineer?</figcaption></figure>\\n<p>Han &#8220;Never tell me the odds&#8221; Solo would laugh at this almost insurance-salesmanlike aversion to risk! Does a smuggler and Rebel give a Jar-Jar-Binks about an unlikely 1% GGP bank default? No sir. Han would rather see the curves for 5% GGP losses, or more. And given the way the areas under probability curves tail off, Han&#8217;s bailout is likely to be a <em>lot</em> cheaper than [Feinstein]&#8217;s. Bravery pays!</p>\\n<h3 id=\\\"its-all-moot-sunk-costs\\\">It&#8217;s All Moot: Sunk Costs</h3>\\n<p>But all this is crazy talk, and we don&#8217;t just mean because all this Star Wars stuff is made up. No, we mean there&#8217;s a fundamental flaw in the argument that the Rebels shouldn&#8217;t attack the Death Stars for economic reasons, and it&#8217;s Econ 101: <a href=\\\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sunk_costs\\\" target=\\\"_blank\\\">sunk costs</a>.</p>\\n<p><a href=\\\"https://hackadaycom.files.wordpress.com/2015/12/yoda_empire_strikes_back.png\\\" rel=\\\"attachment wp-att-182449\\\" target=\\\"_blank\\\"><img class=\\\"alignleft wp-image-182449 size-full\\\" src=\\\"https://hackadaycom.files.wordpress.com/2015/12/yoda_empire_strikes_back.png?w=800\\\" alt=\\\"Yoda_Empire_Strikes_Back\\\"   /></a>To see why, imagine that the Rebels sent in their Jedis and got rid of Palatine and Vader the old-fashioned way, through assassination. No Death Stars destroyed, no collateral damage, but a clean capitulation of the Empire and victory for the Rebels. Hooray, economic collapse averted? Not so fast!</p>\\n<p>The Rebels surely aren&#8217;t going to fund further work on the Death Star &#8212; it&#8217;s not their style. So what are they going to do with it? Renovate and build condos? In that neighborhood? The money wasted on the Death Stars is already wasted, and it&#8217;s not going to be undone. Our guess? The Rebels will just have to demolish it anyway, because you don&#8217;t want an un-powered Death Star falling out of orbit and crashing into the forest moon of Endor.</p>\\n<p>But failing to destroy a Death Star just because it was expensive, even though you have no use for it, is a mistake for young Jedi. As a wise, green professor of mine once said, &#8220;Your choices on decision-relevant criteria based must be!&#8221;</p>\\n<h3 id=\\\"conclusion\\\">Conclusion</h3>\\n<p>This was ridiculous. Hope you had fun. And learned about sunk costs.</p><br />Filed under: <a href=\\\"http://feeds.wordpress.com/1.0/gocomments/hackadaycom.wordpress.com/182444/\\\"href='https://hackaday.com/category/featured/'>Featured</a>  <a rel=\\\"nofollow\\\"  target=\\\"_blank\\\"><img alt=\\\"\\\" border=\\\"0\\\" src=\\\"http://feeds.wordpress.com/1.0/comments/hackadaycom.wordpress.com/182444/\\\" /></a> <img alt=\\\"\\\" border=\\\"0\\\" src=\\\"https://pixel.wp.com/b.gif?host=hackaday.com&#038;blog=4779443&#038;post=182444&#038;subd=hackadaycom&#038;ref=&#038;feed=1\\\" width=\\\"1\\\" height=\\\"1\\\" />\",\"commentRssFeed\":\"https://hackaday.com/2015/12/17/a-scam-of-galactic-proportions/feed/\",\"mediaThumbnail\":\"https://hackadaycom.files.wordpress.com/2015/12/palpatine.jpg?w=150\",\"isOnFrontPage\":true,\"__v\":0,\"mediaContent\":[{\"url\":\"https://hackadaycom.files.wordpress.com/2015/12/palpatine.jpg?w=150\",\"title\":\"Palpatine\",\"_id\":\"5672cf1291eb30fa1e7db079\"},{\"url\":\"https://2.gravatar.com/avatar/89126ee7bae680f1d6d109c79fe970a0?s=96&d=https%3A%2F%2F2.gravatar.com%2Favatar%2Fad516503a11cd5ca435acc9bb6523536%3Fs%3D96\",\"title\":\"hexagon5un\",\"_id\":\"5672cf1291eb30fa1e7db078\"},{\"url\":\"https://hackadaycom.files.wordpress.com/2015/12/d1-14mar-jedi-km1.jpg?w=400\",\"title\":\"d1-14mar-jedi-km1\",\"_id\":\"5672cf1291eb30fa1e7db077\"},{\"url\":\"https://hackadaycom.files.wordpress.com/2015/12/var.png?w=400\",\"title\":\"var\",\"_id\":\"5672cf1291eb30fa1e7db076\"},{\"url\":\"https://hackadaycom.files.wordpress.com/2015/12/feinstein_faculty_bio_72.jpg?w=146\",\"title\":\"Feinstein_faculty_bio_72\",\"_id\":\"5672cf1291eb30fa1e7db075\"},{\"url\":\"https://hackadaycom.files.wordpress.com/2015/12/yoda_empire_strikes_back.png\",\"title\":\"Yoda_Empire_Strikes_Back\",\"_id\":\"5672cf1291eb30fa1e7db074\"}],\"categories\":[\"Featured\",\"bankruptcy\",\"crash\",\"death star\",\"financial markets\",\"star wars\"]}]",

The most glaring departure from the old days: the Explorer kit does not require soldering. The PCB is drilled with oversized holes for machine screws and nuts, and component leads are simply wound around the screws and torqued down. A handy method, perhaps, and accessible to electronics newbies, but hardly suitable for delicate component leads. Indeed, [Spritle] reports several over-torqued screws pinching off component leads almost to the point of not having enough lead left to make a connection. Imagine the frustration of destroying a component and not being able to complete the build.</p>\\n<figure id=\\\"attachment_181579\\\" style=\\\"width: 367px\\\" class=\\\"wp-caption alignleft\\\"><img class=\\\"wp-image-181579 size-medium\\\" src=\\\"https://hackadaycom.files.wordpress.com/2015/12/img_20151130_162543-e1449621477954.jpg?w=357&#038;h=400\\\" alt=\\\"Nice retro look, but is it retro quality?\\\" width=\\\"357\\\" height=\\\"400\\\" /><figcaption class=\\\"wp-caption-text\\\">Nice retro look, but is it retro quality?</figcaption></figure>\\n<p>[Spritle] also reports some disturbing errors with the manual for this kit. Heathkit was famed for the quality of their assembly instructions, and their manuals were the &#8220;holy of holies&#8221; in your project. Nothing else was to be touched before you read the manual, which guided you through the assembly process in exquisite detail. But this manual leaves out instructions for installing one resistor, and gets the color code wrong for another one. Having parts left over on a classic Heathkit project would be an indication that you did something very wrong; a builder not as observant as [Spritle] might have had a very confusing time trying to trace that error. And expecting an electronics newbie, which seems to be the target market for this kit, to catch a color code error is hard to take. Yes, attention to detail is an important skill for the budding electronics hobbyist, but why throw curveballs before the hitter knows how to hold the bat?</p>\\n<p>Personally, I don&#8217;t recall any non-solder kits in the Heathkit catalogs of yore; in fact I recall the instruction manuals having extensive soldering lessons in case your iron handling skills were not quite up to snuff. My first kit, an <a href=\\\"http://www.ohio.edu/people/postr/bapix/SW-717.htm\\\" target=\\\"_blank\\\">SW-717 shortwave receiver</a>, was recommended by my neighbor, a ham trying to get my 11-year-old self into amateur radio. He drilled me on soldering skills for hours before we ever broke open the parts envelopes, and it paid off, both for that build and in the long run with a life skill that I&#8217;m still proud of to this day.</p>\\n<p>Looking back on my first build, it seems like the most valuable part of it was that mentorship. Knowing that I had someone to guide me and answer my questions was incredibly helpful. I&#8217;d love to be on the other side of that mentoring relationship today with my kids, and the Heathkit of old would be a fantastic way to do it. I&#8217;d pay a lot of money to bust open a new Heathkit project with my kids. But a no-solder kit? What&#8217;s the point?</p>\\n<p>I&#8217;m not saying that there&#8217;s no place for a no-solder experience as a &#8220;gateway drug&#8221; to more complicated kits. But the choice of this kit as the first offering is puzzling; it begs the question of where Heathkit sees the company going from here. The price point is baffling too &#8211; $150USD for a battery-powered AM radio with no speaker. Yes, it looks nice, but I&#8217;m not willing to pay a premium for that.</p>\\n<p>Where Heathkit goes from here is anybody&#8217;s guess. Our own [Brian Benchoff] has been keeping close tabs on the <a href=\\\"https://hackaday.com/2015/10/08/heathkit-live-die-repeat/\\\">on again, off again Heathkit reboot</a>, and earlier <a href=\\\"https://hackaday.com/2014/12/22/the-heathkit-mystery/\\\">announcements of a Heathkit return</a> that included a reddit AMA and a bizarre geocache promotion. We really hope that Heathkit makes a comeback, but for now, all we can do is watch and wait. And practice soldering with the kids.</p><br />Filed under: <a href=\\\"http://feeds.wordpress.com/1.0/gocomments/hackadaycom.wordpress.com/180896/\\\"href='https://hackaday.com/category/news/'>news</a>, <a href='https://hackaday.com/category/rants/'>rants</a>  <a rel=\\\"nofollow\\\"  target=\\\"_blank\\\"><img alt=\\\"\\\" border=\\\"0\\\" src=\\\"http://feeds.wordpress.com/1.0/comments/hackadaycom.wordpress.com/180896/\\\" /></a> <img alt=\\\"\\\" border=\\\"0\\\" src=\\\"https://pixel.wp.com/b.gif?host=hackaday.com&#038;blog=4779443&#038;post=180896&#038;subd=hackadaycom&#038;ref=&#038;feed=1\\\" width=\\\"1\\\" height=\\\"1\\\" />\",\"commentRssFeed\":\"https://hackaday.com/2015/12/17/heathkits-triumphant-return/feed/\",\"mediaThumbnail\":\"https://hackadaycom.files.wordpress.com/2015/12/heathkit.jpg?w=150\",\"isOnFrontPage\":true,\"__v\":0,\"mediaContent\":[{\"url\":\"https://hackadaycom.files.wordpress.com/2015/12/heathkit.jpg?w=150\",\"title\":\"Heathkit\",\"_id\":\"5672e42b91eb30fa1e7db16a\"},{\"url\":\"https://1.gravatar.com/avatar/d421f7e52f5be289d90d01e5ab9d65bd?s=96&d=https%3A%2F%2F1.gravatar.com%2Favatar%2Fad516503a11cd5ca435acc9bb6523536%3Fs%3D96\",\"title\":\"dpsm64\",\"_id\":\"5672e42b91eb30fa1e7db169\"},{\"url\":\"https://hackadaycom.files.wordpress.com/2015/12/img_20151202_1703502.jpg?w=400\",\"title\":\"img_20151202_170350\",\"_id\":\"5672e42b91eb30fa1e7db168\"},{\"url\":\"https://hackadaycom.files.wordpress.com/2015/12/img_20151130_162543-e1449621477954.jpg?w=357\",\"title\":\"Nice retro look, but is it retro quality?\",\"_id\":\"5672e42b91eb30fa1e7db167\"}],\"categories\":[\"news\",\"rants\",\"AM Explorer\",\"am radio\",\"diy\",\"heathkit\",\"kit\",\"solder\",\"solderless\",\"SW-717\",\"TRF\"]},{\"_id\":\"5672cf1291eb30fa1e7db073\",\"guid\":\"182444\",\"title\":\"A Scam of Galactic Proportions\",\"link\":\"https://hackaday.com/2015/12/17/a-scam-of-galactic-proportions/\",\"comments\":\"https://hackaday.com/2015/12/17/a-scam-of-galactic-proportions/#respond\",\"pubDate\":\"Thu, 17 Dec 2015 15:01:38 +0000\",\"pubTimeStamp\":\"2015-12-17T20:01:38.000Z\",\"creator\":\"Elliot Williams\",\"guidLink\":\"http://hackaday.com/?p=182444\",\"description\":\"<p>Here at Hackaday we see a lot of technological hoaxes looking for funding.

To quantify any of this, [Feinstein] runs financial crisis models.

But here at Hackaday, we are. And we&#8217;re calling it a hoax. So let&#8217;s look into what the paper gets right, and what makes less sense even than Chewbacca&#8217;s infernal growling. Spoiler: we&#8217;ll get wrapped up in numbers because it&#8217;s fun, but the whole thing is moot for Econ 101-style reasons.</p>\\n<p><span id=\\\"more-182444\\\"></span></p>\\n<h3 id=\\\"the-numbers\\\">The Numbers</h3>\\n<p>[Feinstein] has no numbers for anything, basically. More specifically, he&#8217;s got one: an estimate of the amount of steel it took to build the first Death Star (DS1). And he got this figure from the experts, the United States government.</p>\\n<p><a href=\\\"https://hackadaycom.files.wordpress.com/2015/12/d1-14mar-jedi-km1.jpg\\\" rel=\\\"attachment wp-att-182446\\\" target=\\\"_blank\\\"><img class=\\\"alignright size-medium wp-image-182446\\\" src=\\\"https://hackadaycom.files.wordpress.com/2015/12/d1-14mar-jedi-km1.jpg?w=400&#038;h=300\\\" alt=\\\"d1-14mar-jedi-km1\\\" width=\\\"400\\\" height=\\\"300\\\" /></a>The White House opened up a general-purpose online petition website, and predictably the Internet responded with nearly 40,000 signatures to build a Death Star by 2016. In a brilliant PR move, White House got [Paul Shawcross], Chief of the Science and Space Branch at the Office of Management and Budget <a href=\\\"https://petitions.whitehouse.gov/response/isnt-petition-response-youre-looking\\\" target=\\\"_blank\\\">to write a cheeky response</a>. And [Paul] did what any of us would do &#8212; he typed &#8220;cost of Death Star&#8221; into a search engine and reported what he found: $852 quadrillion. Good enough for government work, right?</p>\\n<p>But the White House got its figures from <a href=\\\"http://www.centives.net/S/2012/how-much-would-it-cost-to-build-the-death-star/\\\" target=\\\"_blank\\\">this website</a> which admits, after much public scrutiny that followed getting picked up by the White House, to have gotten the math wrong by a factor of one hundred! We&#8217;re looking at much more like $8.1 quadrillion. But we&#8217;re quibbling. What&#8217;s a factor of one hundred when the numbers are all made up, top to bottom?</p>\\n<p>Anyway, the absolute value doesn&#8217;t matter as much as the ratio of the cost of the Death Stars to the Empire&#8217;s Gross Galactic Product (GGP). [Feinstein] estimates this by taking the ratio of the cost of the Manhattan Project to the US GDP at the time, which is around 0.21%.</p>\\n<p>We think this is probably an underestimate. The US <a href=\\\"http://data.worldbank.org/indicator/MS.MIL.XPND.GD.ZS\\\" target=\\\"_blank\\\">spends about 4% of GDP on defense <em>per year</em> the last four years</a>, when we weren&#8217;t even facing the existential crisis of a hot war with a Rebel Alliance. For comparison, during WWII, the US spent around 50% of GDP per year on the war effort.</p>\\n<p>The Manhattan Project was also largely a research affair, at least in comparison to building a space station the size of a small planet. We&#8217;d be totally happy to say that the Empire spent 0.2% on Death-Star-related R&amp;D. But we&#8217;ve got to figure something more like 5% or 10% of GGP for as central and apparently ambitious a project as a Death Star. (We do love that [Feinstein] concedes that they could re-use a lot of that R&amp;D expenditure on the second Death Star &#8212; it looks just the same!)</p>\\n<p>So the numbers are all over the place, but if anything [Feinstein] certainly underestimates the importance of the Death Star to the Empire.</p>\\n<h3 id=\\\"banking-the-consequences\\\">Banking: The Consequences</h3>\\n<p>So what happens when the Empire collapses? The banks that they owe money to go bankrupt, and can&#8217;t loan to normal Wookies anymore, and the economy grinds to a halt. Preventing this requires providing the banks with (temporary) liquidity &#8212; bailing them out &#8212; to prevent much larger system-wide harm.</p>\\n<p>[Feinstein] is an expert in modeling financial crises, so we&#8217;re not going to get into those issues except to note that his models are grossly mis-calibrated, not the least due to the easy tenfold underestimate of the cost of the Death Star in terms of GGP. Anyway, he predicts galactic economic chaos.</p>\\n<p><a href=\\\"https://hackadaycom.files.wordpress.com/2015/12/var.png\\\" rel=\\\"attachment wp-att-182451\\\" target=\\\"_blank\\\"><img class=\\\"alignleft wp-image-182451 size-medium\\\" src=\\\"https://hackadaycom.files.wordpress.com/2015/12/var.png?w=400&#038;h=300\\\" alt=\\\"var\\\" width=\\\"400\\\" height=\\\"300\\\" /></a>But there&#8217;s economic chaos and there&#8217;s economic chaos. [Feinstein], a former banker at Lehman Brothers, is no Rebel. He&#8217;s set the 10% <a href=\\\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Value_at_risk\\\" target=\\\"_blank\\\">value-at-risk</a> at 1% of GGP. That is, he&#8217;s saying that the Rebels are trying to limit risk of bank default so thoroughly that a 1% GGP loss would only occur in the worst 10% of scenarios. And to do this, the Rebels would have to budget for a one-time bail out the banks to the tune of up 20% of GGP.</p>\\n<figure id=\\\"attachment_182447\\\" style=\\\"width: 156px\\\" class=\\\"wp-caption alignright\\\"><a href=\\\"https://hackadaycom.files.wordpress.com/2015/12/feinstein_faculty_bio_72.jpg\\\" rel=\\\"attachment wp-att-182447\\\" target=\\\"_blank\\\"><img class=\\\"wp-image-182447 size-thumbnail\\\" src=\\\"https://hackadaycom.files.wordpress.com/2015/12/feinstein_faculty_bio_72.jpg?w=146&#038;h=150\\\" alt=\\\"Feinstein_faculty_bio_72\\\" width=\\\"146\\\" height=\\\"150\\\" /></a><figcaption class=\\\"wp-caption-text\\\">Rebel?

Does a smuggler and Rebel give a Jar-Jar-Binks about an unlikely 1% GGP bank default? No sir. Han would rather see the curves for 5% GGP losses, or more. And given the way the areas under probability curves tail off, Han&#8217;s bailout is likely to be a <em>lot</em> cheaper than [Feinstein]&#8217;s. Bravery pays!</p>\\n<h3 id=\\\"its-all-moot-sunk-costs\\\">It&#8217;s All Moot: Sunk Costs</h3>\\n<p>But all this is crazy talk, and we don&#8217;t just mean because all this Star Wars stuff is made up. No, we mean there&#8217;s a fundamental flaw in the argument that the Rebels shouldn&#8217;t attack the Death Stars for economic reasons, and it&#8217;s Econ 101: <a href=\\\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sunk_costs\\\" target=\\\"_blank\\\">sunk costs</a>.</p>\\n<p><a href=\\\"https://hackadaycom.files.wordpress.com/2015/12/yoda_empire_strikes_back.png\\\" rel=\\\"attachment wp-att-182449\\\" target=\\\"_blank\\\"><img class=\\\"alignleft wp-image-182449 size-full\\\" src=\\\"https://hackadaycom.files.wordpress.com/2015/12/yoda_empire_strikes_back.png?w=800\\\" alt=\\\"Yoda_Empire_Strikes_Back\\\"   /></a>To see why, imagine that the Rebels sent in their Jedis and got rid of Palatine and Vader the old-fashioned way, through assassination. No Death Stars destroyed, no collateral damage, but a clean capitulation of the Empire and victory for the Rebels. Hooray, economic collapse averted? Not so fast!</p>\\n<p>The Rebels surely aren&#8217;t going to fund further work on the Death Star &#8212; it&#8217;s not their style. So what are they going to do with it? Renovate and build condos? In that neighborhood? The money wasted on the Death Stars is already wasted, and it&#8217;s not going to be undone. Our guess? The Rebels will just have to demolish it anyway, because you don&#8217;t want an un-powered Death Star falling out of orbit and crashing into the forest moon of Endor.</p>\\n<p>But failing to destroy a Death Star just because it was expensive, even though you have no use for it, is a mistake for young Jedi. As a wise, green professor of mine once said, &#8220;Your choices on decision-relevant criteria based must be!&#8221;</p>\\n<h3 id=\\\"conclusion\\\">Conclusion</h3>\\n<p>This was ridiculous.

All the hardware was had on the cheap from an outfit called <a href=\\\"http://www.cdrking.com/?mod=products&amp;type=list\\\" target=\\\"_blank\\\">Cd-r King</a>, a Phillipines-based discount gadgetorium we&#8217;d like to see in the states. He got a handful of USB power packs and harvested the single 18650 battery from each, whipped up a quick battery holder from 1/2&#8243; PVC pipe and some bolts to connect the inverter. With four batteries in series he was able to run a flat-screen TV with ease, as well as a large floor fan &#8211; say, is that a <a href=\\\"https://hackaday.com/2014/12/08/the-last-week-of-the-mooltipass-approacheth/\\\">Mooltipass</a> on [Stephen]&#8217;s shelf in the background?

More batteries in parallel for longer run times is an obvious first step.

There are equations and variables to calculate, possibly some empirical measurements by measuring the resistance of a trace, but Ohm&#8217;s Law is a law for a reason. If you do things right, you can make a PCB heat bed perfectly suited for the task. You can even design in safety features like overcurrent protection and fuses. It can&#8217;t be that hard. After all, your house is full of devices that are plugged into the wall.</p>\\n<p>However, there&#8217;s a reason we use 12V and 24V heated beds &#8211; they give us, at the very least, the illusion of safety. Therefore, [Makertum] is looking for a few comments from specialists and people who know what they&#8217;re doing.</p>\\n<p>Although a mains powered heated bed sounds scary for a hobbyist-built 3D printer, there are a number of positives to the design. It would heat up faster, thin down a few parts, and significantly reduce the overall cost of the printer by not requiring another 100 Watts delivered from a 12V power supply. It&#8217;s a great idea if it doesn&#8217;t burn down the house.

The most glaring departure from the old days: the Explorer kit does not require soldering. The PCB is drilled with oversized holes for machine screws and nuts, and component leads are simply wound around the screws and torqued down. A handy method, perhaps, and accessible to electronics newbies, but hardly suitable for delicate component leads. Indeed, [Spritle] reports several over-torqued screws pinching off component leads almost to the point of not having enough lead left to make a connection. Imagine the frustration of destroying a component and not being able to complete the build.</p>\\n<figure id=\\\"attachment_181579\\\" style=\\\"width: 367px\\\" class=\\\"wp-caption alignleft\\\"><img class=\\\"wp-image-181579 size-medium\\\" src=\\\"https://hackadaycom.files.wordpress.com/2015/12/img_20151130_162543-e1449621477954.jpg?w=357&#038;h=400\\\" alt=\\\"Nice retro look, but is it retro quality?\\\" width=\\\"357\\\" height=\\\"400\\\" /><figcaption class=\\\"wp-caption-text\\\">Nice retro look, but is it retro quality?</figcaption></figure>\\n<p>[Spritle] also reports some disturbing errors with the manual for this kit. Heathkit was famed for the quality of their assembly instructions, and their manuals were the &#8220;holy of holies&#8221; in your project. Nothing else was to be touched before you read the manual, which guided you through the assembly process in exquisite detail. But this manual leaves out instructions for installing one resistor, and gets the color code wrong for another one. Having parts left over on a classic Heathkit project would be an indication that you did something very wrong; a builder not as observant as [Spritle] might have had a very confusing time trying to trace that error. And expecting an electronics newbie, which seems to be the target market for this kit, to catch a color code error is hard to take. Yes, attention to detail is an important skill for the budding electronics hobbyist, but why throw curveballs before the hitter knows how to hold the bat?</p>\\n<p>Personally, I don&#8217;t recall any non-solder kits in the Heathkit catalogs of yore; in fact I recall the instruction manuals having extensive soldering lessons in case your iron handling skills were not quite up to snuff. My first kit, an <a href=\\\"http://www.ohio.edu/people/postr/bapix/SW-717.htm\\\" target=\\\"_blank\\\">SW-717 shortwave receiver</a>, was recommended by my neighbor, a ham trying to get my 11-year-old self into amateur radio. He drilled me on soldering skills for hours before we ever broke open the parts envelopes, and it paid off, both for that build and in the long run with a life skill that I&#8217;m still proud of to this day.</p>\\n<p>Looking back on my first build, it seems like the most valuable part of it was that mentorship. Knowing that I had someone to guide me and answer my questions was incredibly helpful. I&#8217;d love to be on the other side of that mentoring relationship today with my kids, and the Heathkit of old would be a fantastic way to do it. I&#8217;d pay a lot of money to bust open a new Heathkit project with my kids. But a no-solder kit? What&#8217;s the point?</p>\\n<p>I&#8217;m not saying that there&#8217;s no place for a no-solder experience as a &#8220;gateway drug&#8221; to more complicated kits. But the choice of this kit as the first offering is puzzling; it begs the question of where Heathkit sees the company going from here. The price point is baffling too &#8211; $150USD for a battery-powered AM radio with no speaker. Yes, it looks nice, but I&#8217;m not willing to pay a premium for that.</p>\\n<p>Where Heathkit goes from here is anybody&#8217;s guess. Our own [Brian Benchoff] has been keeping close tabs on the <a href=\\\"https://hackaday.com/2015/10/08/heathkit-live-die-repeat/\\\">on again, off again Heathkit reboot</a>, and earlier <a href=\\\"https://hackaday.com/2014/12/22/the-heathkit-mystery/\\\">announcements of a Heathkit return</a> that included a reddit AMA and a bizarre geocache promotion. We really hope that Heathkit makes a comeback, but for now, all we can do is watch and wait. And practice soldering with the kids.</p><br />Filed under: <a href=\\\"http://feeds.wordpress.com/1.0/gocomments/hackadaycom.wordpress.com/180896/\\\"href='https://hackaday.com/category/news/'>news</a>, <a href='https://hackaday.com/category/rants/'>rants</a>  <a rel=\\\"nofollow\\\"  target=\\\"_blank\\\"><img alt=\\\"\\\" border=\\\"0\\\" src=\\\"http://feeds.wordpress.com/1.0/comments/hackadaycom.wordpress.com/180896/\\\" /></a> <img alt=\\\"\\\" border=\\\"0\\\" src=\\\"https://pixel.wp.com/b.gif?host=hackaday.com&#038;blog=4779443&#038;post=180896&#038;subd=hackadaycom&#038;ref=&#038;feed=1\\\" width=\\\"1\\\" height=\\\"1\\\" />\",\"commentRssFeed\":\"https://hackaday.com/2015/12/17/heathkits-triumphant-return/feed/\",\"mediaThumbnail\":\"https://hackadaycom.files.wordpress.com/2015/12/heathkit.jpg?w=150\",\"isOnFrontPage\":true,\"__v\":0,\"mediaContent\":[{\"url\":\"https://hackadaycom.files.wordpress.com/2015/12/heathkit.jpg?w=150\",\"title\":\"Heathkit\",\"_id\":\"5672e42b91eb30fa1e7db16a\"},{\"url\":\"https://1.gravatar.com/avatar/d421f7e52f5be289d90d01e5ab9d65bd?s=96&d=https%3A%2F%2F1.gravatar.com%2Favatar%2Fad516503a11cd5ca435acc9bb6523536%3Fs%3D96\",\"title\":\"dpsm64\",\"_id\":\"5672e42b91eb30fa1e7db169\"},{\"url\":\"https://hackadaycom.files.wordpress.com/2015/12/img_20151202_1703502.jpg?w=400\",\"title\":\"img_20151202_170350\",\"_id\":\"5672e42b91eb30fa1e7db168\"},{\"url\":\"https://hackadaycom.files.wordpress.com/2015/12/img_20151130_162543-e1449621477954.jpg?w=357\",\"title\":\"Nice retro look, but is it retro quality?\",\"_id\":\"5672e42b91eb30fa1e7db167\"}],\"categories\":[\"news\",\"rants\",\"AM Explorer\",\"am radio\",\"diy\",\"heathkit\",\"kit\",\"solder\",\"solderless\",\"SW-717\",\"TRF\"]},{\"_id\":\"5672cf1291eb30fa1e7db073\",\"guid\":\"182444\",\"title\":\"A Scam of Galactic Proportions\",\"link\":\"https://hackaday.com/2015/12/17/a-scam-of-galactic-proportions/\",\"comments\":\"https://hackaday.com/2015/12/17/a-scam-of-galactic-proportions/#respond\",\"pubDate\":\"Thu, 17 Dec 2015 15:01:38 +0000\",\"pubTimeStamp\":\"2015-12-17T20:01:38.000Z\",\"creator\":\"Elliot Williams\",\"guidLink\":\"http://hackaday.com/?p=182444\",\"description\":\"<p>Here at Hackaday we see a lot of technological hoaxes looking for funding.

So he&#8217;s just exactly the guy you&#8217;d tap to write a paper on <a href=\\\"http://arxiv.org/pdf/1511.09054v1.pdf\\\" target=\\\"_blank\\\">the financial repercussions of the destruction of the Death Stars in Star Wars (PDF)</a>. Wait, what?</p>\\n<p>The central argument of the paper is that, since the Empire has so much money wrapped up in building the Death Stars, it&#8217;s economic suicide for the Rebels to destroy it. To quantify any of this, [Feinstein] runs financial crisis models. The idea is that the Rebels win, but they inherit an economy that&#8217;s so dysfunctional that they&#8217;d have been better off not destroying the Death Stars.</p>\\n<p>We&#8217;re not saying that the rest of the <a href=\\\"http://www.nbcnews.com/pop-culture/movies/star-wars-destroying-death-star-would-trigger-economic-crisis-n472631?cid=par-time_20151202\\\" target=\\\"_blank\\\">press is gullible</a>, but we are saying that they&#8217;re <a href=\\\"http://news.nationalpost.com/arts/movies/blowing-up-the-death-star-in-star-wars-would-have-cost-more-than-500-quintillion-and-crippled-the-galaxy\\\" target=\\\"_blank\\\">not putting their best economists onto articles about financing Death Stars</a>. But here at Hackaday, we are. And we&#8217;re calling it a hoax. So let&#8217;s look into what the paper gets right, and what makes less sense even than Chewbacca&#8217;s infernal growling. Spoiler: we&#8217;ll get wrapped up in numbers because it&#8217;s fun, but the whole thing is moot for Econ 101-style reasons.</p>\\n<p><span id=\\\"more-182444\\\"></span></p>\\n<h3 id=\\\"the-numbers\\\">The Numbers</h3>\\n<p>[Feinstein] has no numbers for anything, basically. More specifically, he&#8217;s got one: an estimate of the amount of steel it took to build the first Death Star (DS1). And he got this figure from the experts, the United States government.</p>\\n<p><a href=\\\"https://hackadaycom.files.wordpress.com/2015/12/d1-14mar-jedi-km1.jpg\\\" rel=\\\"attachment wp-att-182446\\\" target=\\\"_blank\\\"><img class=\\\"alignright size-medium wp-image-182446\\\" src=\\\"https://hackadaycom.files.wordpress.com/2015/12/d1-14mar-jedi-km1.jpg?w=400&#038;h=300\\\" alt=\\\"d1-14mar-jedi-km1\\\" width=\\\"400\\\" height=\\\"300\\\" /></a>The White House opened up a general-purpose online petition website, and predictably the Internet responded with nearly 40,000 signatures to build a Death Star by 2016. In a brilliant PR move, White House got [Paul Shawcross], Chief of the Science and Space Branch at the Office of Management and Budget <a href=\\\"https://petitions.whitehouse.gov/response/isnt-petition-response-youre-looking\\\" target=\\\"_blank\\\">to write a cheeky response</a>. And [Paul] did what any of us would do &#8212; he typed &#8220;cost of Death Star&#8221; into a search engine and reported what he found: $852 quadrillion. Good enough for government work, right?</p>\\n<p>But the White House got its figures from <a href=\\\"http://www.centives.net/S/2012/how-much-would-it-cost-to-build-the-death-star/\\\" target=\\\"_blank\\\">this website</a> which admits, after much public scrutiny that followed getting picked up by the White House, to have gotten the math wrong by a factor of one hundred! We&#8217;re looking at much more like $8.1 quadrillion. But we&#8217;re quibbling. What&#8217;s a factor of one hundred when the numbers are all made up, top to bottom?</p>\\n<p>Anyway, the absolute value doesn&#8217;t matter as much as the ratio of the cost of the Death Stars to the Empire&#8217;s Gross Galactic Product (GGP). [Feinstein] estimates this by taking the ratio of the cost of the Manhattan Project to the US GDP at the time, which is around 0.21%.</p>\\n<p>We think this is probably an underestimate. The US <a href=\\\"http://data.worldbank.org/indicator/MS.MIL.XPND.GD.ZS\\\" target=\\\"_blank\\\">spends about 4% of GDP on defense <em>per year</em> the last four years</a>, when we weren&#8217;t even facing the existential crisis of a hot war with a Rebel Alliance. For comparison, during WWII, the US spent around 50% of GDP per year on the war effort.</p>\\n<p>The Manhattan Project was also largely a research affair, at least in comparison to building a space station the size of a small planet. We&#8217;d be totally happy to say that the Empire spent 0.2% on Death-Star-related R&amp;D. But we&#8217;ve got to figure something more like 5% or 10% of GGP for as central and apparently ambitious a project as a Death Star. (We do love that [Feinstein] concedes that they could re-use a lot of that R&amp;D expenditure on the second Death Star &#8212; it looks just the same!)</p>\\n<p>So the numbers are all over the place, but if anything [Feinstein] certainly underestimates the importance of the Death Star to the Empire.</p>\\n<h3 id=\\\"banking-the-consequences\\\">Banking: The Consequences</h3>\\n<p>So what happens when the Empire collapses? The banks that they owe money to go bankrupt, and can&#8217;t loan to normal Wookies anymore, and the economy grinds to a halt. Preventing this requires providing the banks with (temporary) liquidity &#8212; bailing them out &#8212; to prevent much larger system-wide harm.</p>\\n<p>[Feinstein] is an expert in modeling financial crises, so we&#8217;re not going to get into those issues except to note that his models are grossly mis-calibrated, not the least due to the easy tenfold underestimate of the cost of the Death Star in terms of GGP. Anyway, he predicts galactic economic chaos.</p>\\n<p><a href=\\\"https://hackadaycom.files.wordpress.com/2015/12/var.png\\\" rel=\\\"attachment wp-att-182451\\\" target=\\\"_blank\\\"><img class=\\\"alignleft wp-image-182451 size-medium\\\" src=\\\"https://hackadaycom.files.wordpress.com/2015/12/var.png?w=400&#038;h=300\\\" alt=\\\"var\\\" width=\\\"400\\\" height=\\\"300\\\" /></a>But there&#8217;s economic chaos and there&#8217;s economic chaos. [Feinstein], a former banker at Lehman Brothers, is no Rebel. He&#8217;s set the 10% <a href=\\\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Value_at_risk\\\" target=\\\"_blank\\\">value-at-risk</a> at 1% of GGP. That is, he&#8217;s saying that the Rebels are trying to limit risk of bank default so thoroughly that a 1% GGP loss would only occur in the worst 10% of scenarios. And to do this, the Rebels would have to budget for a one-time bail out the banks to the tune of up 20% of GGP.</p>\\n<figure id=\\\"attachment_182447\\\" style=\\\"width: 156px\\\" class=\\\"wp-caption alignright\\\"><a href=\\\"https://hackadaycom.files.wordpress.com/2015/12/feinstein_faculty_bio_72.jpg\\\" rel=\\\"attachment wp-att-182447\\\" target=\\\"_blank\\\"><img class=\\\"wp-image-182447 size-thumbnail\\\" src=\\\"https://hackadaycom.files.wordpress.com/2015/12/feinstein_faculty_bio_72.jpg?w=146&#038;h=150\\\" alt=\\\"Feinstein_faculty_bio_72\\\" width=\\\"146\\\" height=\\\"150\\\" /></a><figcaption class=\\\"wp-caption-text\\\">Rebel? Or Financial Engineer?</figcaption></figure>\\n<p>Han &#8220;Never tell me the odds&#8221; Solo would laugh at this almost insurance-salesmanlike aversion to risk! Does a smuggler and Rebel give a Jar-Jar-Binks about an unlikely 1% GGP bank default? No sir. Han would rather see the curves for 5% GGP losses, or more. And given the way the areas under probability curves tail off, Han&#8217;s bailout is likely to be a <em>lot</em> cheaper than [Feinstein]&#8217;s. Bravery pays!</p>\\n<h3 id=\\\"its-all-moot-sunk-costs\\\">It&#8217;s All Moot: Sunk Costs</h3>\\n<p>But all this is crazy talk, and we don&#8217;t just mean because all this Star Wars stuff is made up. No, we mean there&#8217;s a fundamental flaw in the argument that the Rebels shouldn&#8217;t attack the Death Stars for economic reasons, and it&#8217;s Econ 101: <a href=\\\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sunk_costs\\\" target=\\\"_blank\\\">sunk costs</a>.</p>\\n<p><a href=\\\"https://hackadaycom.files.wordpress.com/2015/12/yoda_empire_strikes_back.png\\\" rel=\\\"attachment wp-att-182449\\\" target=\\\"_blank\\\"><img class=\\\"alignleft wp-image-182449 size-full\\\" src=\\\"https://hackadaycom.files.wordpress.com/2015/12/yoda_empire_strikes_back.png?w=800\\\" alt=\\\"Yoda_Empire_Strikes_Back\\\"   /></a>To see why, imagine that the Rebels sent in their Jedis and got rid of Palatine and Vader the old-fashioned way, through assassination. No Death Stars destroyed, no collateral damage, but a clean capitulation of the Empire and victory for the Rebels. Hooray, economic collapse averted? Not so fast!</p>\\n<p>The Rebels surely aren&#8217;t going to fund further work on the Death Star &#8212; it&#8217;s not their style. So what are they going to do with it? Renovate and build condos? In that neighborhood? The money wasted on the Death Stars is already wasted, and it&#8217;s not going to be undone. Our guess? The Rebels will just have to demolish it anyway, because you don&#8217;t want an un-powered Death Star falling out of orbit and crashing into the forest moon of Endor.</p>\\n<p>But failing to destroy a Death Star just because it was expensive, even though you have no use for it, is a mistake for young Jedi. As a wise, green professor of mine once said, &#8220;Your choices on decision-relevant criteria based must be!&#8221;</p>\\n<h3 id=\\\"conclusion\\\">Conclusion</h3>\\n<p>This was ridiculous. Hope you had fun. And learned about sunk costs.</p><br />Filed under: <a href=\\\"http://feeds.wordpress.com/1.0/gocomments/hackadaycom.wordpress.com/182444/\\\"href='https://hackaday.com/category/featured/'>Featured</a>  <a rel=\\\"nofollow\\\"  target=\\\"_blank\\\"><img alt=\\\"\\\" border=\\\"0\\\" src=\\\"http://feeds.wordpress.com/1.0/comments/hackadaycom.wordpress.com/182444/\\\" /></a> <img alt=\\\"\\\" border=\\\"0\\\" src=\\\"https://pixel.wp.com/b.gif?host=hackaday.com&#038;blog=4779443&#038;post=182444&#038;subd=hackadaycom&#038;ref=&#038;feed=1\\\" width=\\\"1\\\" height=\\\"1\\\" />\",\"commentRssFeed\":\"https://hackaday.com/2015/12/17/a-scam-of-galactic-proportions/feed/\",\"mediaThumbnail\":\"https://hackadaycom.files.wordpress.com/2015/12/palpatine.jpg?w=150\",\"isOnFrontPage\":true,\"__v\":0,\"mediaContent\":[{\"url\":\"https://hackadaycom.files.wordpress.com/2015/12/palpatine.jpg?w=150\",\"title\":\"Palpatine\",\"_id\":\"5672cf1291eb30fa1e7db079\"},{\"url\":\"https://2.gravatar.com/avatar/89126ee7bae680f1d6d109c79fe970a0?s=96&d=https%3A%2F%2F2.gravatar.com%2Favatar%2Fad516503a11cd5ca435acc9bb6523536%3Fs%3D96\",\"title\":\"hexagon5un\",\"_id\":\"5672cf1291eb30fa1e7db078\"},{\"url\":\"https://hackadaycom.files.wordpress.com/2015/12/d1-14mar-jedi-km1.jpg?w=400\",\"title\":\"d1-14mar-jedi-km1\",\"_id\":\"5672cf1291eb30fa1e7db077\"},{\"url\":\"https://hackadaycom.files.wordpress.com/2015/12/var.png?w=400\",\"title\":\"var\",\"_id\":\"5672cf1291eb30fa1e7db076\"},{\"url\":\"https://hackadaycom.files.wordpress.com/2015/12/feinstein_faculty_bio_72.jpg?w=146\",\"title\":\"Feinstein_faculty_bio_72\",\"_id\":\"5672cf1291eb30fa1e7db075\"},{\"url\":\"https://hackadaycom.files.wordpress.com/2015/12/yoda_empire_strikes_back.png\",\"title\":\"Yoda_Empire_Strikes_Back\",\"_id\":\"5672cf1291eb30fa1e7db074\"}],\"categories\":[\"Featured\",\"bankruptcy\",\"crash\",\"death star\",\"financial markets\",\"star wars\"]}]",
