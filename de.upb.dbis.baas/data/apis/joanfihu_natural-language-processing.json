It was never implemented, partly because of the complexity of banking regulations. He revived the effort in 2013. &#8220;We are looking at micropayment protocols again,&#8221; he said. &#8220;The ability to pay for a good article or song could support more people who write things or make music.&#8221;</p>\\n<p class=\\\"p1\\\">These micropayment protocols still have not been written. But Bitcoin may be making that unnecessary. One of the greatest advocates of using Bitcoin for micropayments is the venture capitalist Marc Andreessen, who as a student at the University of Illinois in 1993 created the first popular Web browser, Mosaic.</p>\\n<p class=\\\"p1\\\">Originally, Andreessen had hoped to put a digital currency into his browser. &#8220;When we started, the first thing we tried to do was enable small payments to people who posted content,&#8221; he explained. &#8220;But we didn&#8217;t have the resources to implement that. The credit card systems and banking system made it impossible. It was so painful to deal with those guys. It was cosmically painful.&#8221;</p>\\n<p class=\\\"p1\\\">Now Andreessen has become a major investor in companies that are creating Bitcoin transaction systems. &#8220;If I had a time machine and could go back to 1993, one thing I&#8217;d do for sure would be to build in Bitcoin or some similar form of cryptocurrency.&#8221;</p>\\n<p class=\\\"p1\\\">Walter Isaacson, a former managing editor of Time, is the author of The Innovators: How a Group of Hackers, Geniuses, and Geeks Created the Digital Revolution, out this week. </p>\\n \\n\\n</section>\\n\", \n    \"content_cleaned\": \"Walter Isaacson is the author of The Innovators: How a Group of Hackers, Geniuses, and Geeks Created the Digital Revolution, out this week.\\n\\nThe rise of Bitcoin, the digital cryptocurrency, has resurrected the hope of facilitating easy micropayments for content online. \\u201cUsing Bitcoin micropayments to allow for payment of a penny or a few cents to read articles on websites enables reasonable compensation of authors without depending totally on the advertising model,\\u201d writes Sandy Ressler in Bitcoin Magazine.\\n\\nThis could lead to a whole new era of creativity, just like the economy that was launched 400 years ago by the Statute of Anne, which gave people who wrote books, plays or songs the right to make a royalty when they were copied.

It was never implemented, partly because of the complexity of banking regulations. He revived the effort in 2013. \\u201cWe are looking at micropayment protocols again,\\u201d he said. \\u201cThe ability to pay for a good article or song could support more people who write things or make music.\\u201d\\n\\nThese micropayment protocols still have not been written. But Bitcoin may be making that unnecessary. One of the greatest advocates of using Bitcoin for micropayments is the venture capitalist Marc Andreessen, who as a student at the University of Illinois in 1993 created the first popular Web browser, Mosaic.\\n\\nOriginally, Andreessen had hoped to put a digital currency into his browser. \\u201cWhen we started, the first thing we tried to do was enable small payments to people who posted content,\\u201d he explained. \\u201cBut we didn\\u2019t have the resources to implement that. The credit card systems and banking system made it impossible. It was so painful to deal with those guys. It was cosmically painful.\\u201d\\n\\nNow Andreessen has become a major investor in companies that are creating Bitcoin transaction systems. \\u201cIf I had a time machine and could go back to 1993, one thing I\\u2019d do for sure would be to build in Bitcoin or some similar form of cryptocurrency.\\u201d\\n\\nWalter Isaacson, a former managing editor of Time, is the author of The Innovators: How a Group of Hackers, Geniuses, and Geeks Created the Digital Revolution, out this week.\", \n    \"entities\": [\n      \"Marc Andreessen\", \n      \"PayPal\", \n      \"Bitcoin\", \n      \"Illinois\", \n      \"Ted Nelson\", \n      \"Tim\", \n      \"Anne\", \n      \"Bitcoin Magazine\", \n      \"AOL\", \n      \"Sandy Ressler\", \n      \"Mosaic\", \n      \"University\", \n      \"BitPay\", \n      \"BitWall\", \n      \"English\", \n      \"Andreessen\", \n      \"Geniuses\", \n      \"Walter Isaacson\", \n      \"Hackers\", \n      \"Geeks\", \n      \"Digital Revolution\", \n      \"ChangeTip\", \n      \"Compuserve\"\n    ], \n    \"image\": \"http://timedotcom.files.wordpress.com/2014/10/the-innovators.jpg?w=232\", \n    \"keywords\": [\n      \"system\", \n      \"charge\", \n      \"resources\", \n      \"pay\", \n      \"song\", \n      \"rise\", \n      \"penny\", \n      \"didn\\u2019t\", \n      \"geniuses geeks\", \n      \"group hackers\", \n      \"hackers geniuses\", \n      \"impulse purchases\", \n      \"revolution week\", \n      \"author innovators\", \n      \"save journalism\", \n      \"enable small\"\n    ], \n    \"lang\": null, \n    \"link\": \"http://time.com/3476313/can-bitcoin-save-journalism/\", \n    \"published\": \"Tue, 07 Oct 2014 14:51:19 +0000\", \n    \"qualityScore\": 100, \n    \"summaries\": [\n      \"Had Nelson\\u2019s system prevailed, it would have been possible for small payments to accrue to those who produced the content.\", \n      \"But Bitcoin has now spawned services such as ChangeTip, BitWall, BitPay and Coinbase that enable small payments to be made simply, with minimal mental friction or transaction costs.\", \n      \"When the open Internet became an alternative to these proprietary online services, it seemed to offer an opportunity to take control of our own destiny and subscribers.\", \n      \"Walter Isaacson is the author of The Innovators: How a Group of Hackers, Geniuses, and Geeks Created the Digital Revolution, out this week.\", \n      \"Initially we were paid by the dial-up online services, such as AOL and Compuserve, to supply content, market their services, and moderate bulletin boards that built up communities of members.\"\n    ], \n    \"timestamp\": 1412693479, \n    \"title\": \"How Bitcoin Could Save Journalism and the Arts\"\n  }\n}",

And films aimed at girls tend to teach them to work together and make allies to overcome problems (i.e. The Wizard of Oz.)</p>\\n<p>The question he has: why aren&#8217;t there films focused on gaining allies and solving things diplomatically aimed at boys? Why aren&#8217;t there more films that teach young men not to objectify women and treat them as the reward they are entitled to? Most importantly, Colin talks about what we as parents can do about it.</p>\\n \\n \\n<p>Is there an algorithm for love? Statistician Amy Webb analyzed not only what she wanted out of a potential husband, but also what men she liked were looking for. Using this process, she altered her online dating profile and it caught the eye of the man she would end up marrying.</p>\\n<p>This is not just a story about how to find the ideal mate, but how to approach any passion in your life in a way that gets you what you want in a smart way designed for success.</p>\\n \\n \\n<p>Though the &#8220;Last Lecture&#8221; series at Carnegie Mellon University is themed around what the professors&#8217; last lectures would be, for Randy Pausch, who had recently been diagnosed with terminal cancer, this would literally be his last lecture. But don&#8217;t think this video is a downer because Pausch is dying: He&#8217;s in good humor, and you&#8217;re guaranteed to crack a smile while watching his inspirational talk about how to live life to its fullest.</p>\\n<p>Told through Pausch&#8217;s reminiscing, his lecture focuses on achieving one&#8217;s childhood dreams and, even better, how to help others achieve their dreams. At over an hour in length, it&#8217;s well worth your time.</p>\\n \\n \\n<p>Several years before his death, the Apple CEO gave the commencement address to the graduates at Stanford University. In it, he talks about his own life: He dropped out of college after six months, unable to see the value in whiling away all of his parents&#8217; savings. He didn&#8217;t know how at the time, but he hoped it would all work out &#8212; and if you know anything about the story of his life, it did.</p>\\n<p>His message of believing in yourself and following your own path is full of humor and insight. It isn&#8217;t to be missed and only clocks in at a little more than 15 minutes.</p>\\n \\n \\n<p>We live in a world that doesn&#8217;t always cater to the needs of introverts&#8212;a personality type that accounts for a third to half of all people and tends to prefer quiet over loud, isolation over socialization. Cain, an introvert and the author of Quiet: The Power of Introverts, offers a thought-provoking argument that suggests introverts have as much to offer the world as their extroverted brethren.</p>\\n<p>One of the more popular TEDTalks, The Power of Introverts runs just under 20 minutes and may make you see a new side of yourself or those around you.</p>\\n \\n \\n<p>Don&#8217;t know what a filter bubble is? It&#8217;s a phenomenon unique to the Internet-era in which our interests and preferences tailor the kinds of content we see on search engines and social channels. And while it can be helpful in directing us to the information most relevant to us, in this nine-minute TEDTalk, Eli Pariser explains that it can also prevent us from seeing opposing viewpoints.</p>\\n \\n \\n<p>Facebook COO Sheryl Sandberg is well-known as a business leader who&#8217;s been outspoken on the subject of women in the workplace. So it&#8217;s no surprise that when she spoke at a TED Conference, she gave a 15-minute passionate argument for why we need more women leaders in the world. She also focuses on the messages we send women about working and the messages we send our daughters as well.</p>\\n<p>This article was written by Elizabeth Harper and originally appeared on Techlicious.</p>\\n \\n</section>\\n\", \n    \"content_cleaned\": \"While you may think of YouTube as a place to check out the latest in funny animal videos, there\\u2019s a lot of content that caters to the brain rather than the funny bone.\\n\\nWe\\u2019ve found the best and brightest videos for you to enjoy when you need to stretch your mental muscles.

Statistician Amy Webb analyzed not only what she wanted out of a potential husband, but also what men she liked were looking for. Using this process, she altered her online dating profile and it caught the eye of the man she would end up marrying.\\n\\nThis is not just a story about how to find the ideal mate, but how to approach any passion in your life in a way that gets you what you want in a smart way designed for success.\\n\\nThough the \\u201cLast Lecture\\u201d series at Carnegie Mellon University is themed around what the professors\\u2019 last lectures would be, for Randy Pausch, who had recently been diagnosed with terminal cancer, this would literally be his last lecture. But don\\u2019t think this video is a downer because Pausch is dying: He\\u2019s in good humor, and you\\u2019re guaranteed to crack a smile while watching his inspirational talk about how to live life to its fullest.\\n\\nTold through Pausch\\u2019s reminiscing, his lecture focuses on achieving one\\u2019s childhood dreams and, even better, how to help others achieve their dreams. At over an hour in length, it\\u2019s well worth your time.\\n\\nSeveral years before his death, the Apple CEO gave the commencement address to the graduates at Stanford University. In it, he talks about his own life: He dropped out of college after six months, unable to see the value in whiling away all of his parents\\u2019 savings. He didn\\u2019t know how at the time, but he hoped it would all work out \\u2014 and if you know anything about the story of his life, it did.\\n\\nHis message of believing in yourself and following your own path is full of humor and insight. It isn\\u2019t to be missed and only clocks in at a little more than 15 minutes.\\n\\nWe live in a world that doesn\\u2019t always cater to the needs of introverts\\u2014a personality type that accounts for a third to half of all people and tends to prefer quiet over loud, isolation over socialization. Cain, an introvert and the author of Quiet: The Power of Introverts, offers a thought-provoking argument that suggests introverts have as much to offer the world as their extroverted brethren.\\n\\nOne of the more popular TEDTalks, The Power of Introverts runs just under 20 minutes and may make you see a new side of yourself or those around you.\\n\\nDon\\u2019t know what a filter bubble is? It\\u2019s a phenomenon unique to the Internet-era in which our interests and preferences tailor the kinds of content we see on search engines and social channels. And while it can be helpful in directing us to the information most relevant to us, in this nine-minute TEDTalk, Eli Pariser explains that it can also prevent us from seeing opposing viewpoints.\\n\\nFacebook COO Sheryl Sandberg is well-known as a business leader who\\u2019s been outspoken on the subject of women in the workplace. So it\\u2019s no surprise that when she spoke at a TED Conference, she gave a 15-minute passionate argument for why we need more women leaders in the world. She also focuses on the messages we send women about working and the messages we send our daughters as well.\\n\\nThis article was written by Elizabeth Harper and originally appeared on Techlicious.\", \n    \"entities\": [\n      \"Introverts\", \n      \"Randy Pausch\", \n      \"Pray\", \n      \"YouTube\", \n      \"Stanford University\", \n      \"Father\", \n      \"Carnegie Mellon University\", \n      \"Love\", \n      \"Gilbert\", \n      \"TEDTalk\", \n      \"Yellow Brick Road\", \n      \"Told\", \n      \"Scientist Dan Gilbert\", \n      \"Statistician Amy Webb\", \n      \"Watch\", \n      \"TED Conference\", \n      \"Facebook\", \n      \"Eat\", \n      \"Stephen Hawking\", \n      \"Quiet\", \n      \"Cain\", \n      \"Colin Stokes\", \n      \"Eli Pariser\", \n      \"Monet\", \n      \"Apple\", \n      \"Pausch\", \n      \"Colin\", \n      \"Mick Jagger\", \n      \"Elizabeth Harper\"\n    ], \n    \"image\": \"http://s0.wp.com/wp-content/themes/vip/time2014/img/time-logo-og.png?m=1391184390g\", \n    \"keywords\": [\n      \"yellow\", \n      \"alien\", \n      \"talks\", \n      \"content\", \n      \"wizard\", \n      \"father\", \n      \"young\", \n      \"send\", \n      \"smile\", \n      \"power introverts\", \n      \"aren\\u2019t films\"\n    ], \n    \"lang\": null, \n    \"link\": \"http://time.com/3481914/inspiring-youtube-videos/\", \n    \"published\": \"Wed, 08 Oct 2014 16:25:52 +0000\", \n    \"qualityScore\": 100, \n    \"summaries\": [\n      \"While you may think of YouTube as a place to check out the latest in funny animal videos, there\\u2019s a lot of content that caters to the brain rather than the funny bone.\", \n      \"Star Wars.)

As part of the lease, Google will take over operations of the airfield while the U.S. government retains ownership of the land.  In a press release, NASA announced that Planetary Ventures LLC, a shell organization operated by Google for real estate deals, will contribute $1.16 billion over the course of the lease, while reducing the government agency’s maintenance and operation costs by $6.3 million annually.  The best part of the press release is this quote from NASA Administrator Charles Bolden: “As NASA expands its presence in space, we are making strides to reduce our footprint here on Earth,” he says.  NASA and the U.S. General Services Administration (GSA) will continue to own the 1,000 acres of land in Mountain View, Calif., which includes Hangars One, Two, and Three, an airfield flight operations building, two runways, and a private golf course. But for all intents and purposes, they will be handing over operations to Google through Planetary Ventures.",

As part of the lease, Google will take over operations of the airfield while the U.S. government retains ownership of the land.  In a press release, NASA announced that Planetary Ventures LLC, a shell organization operated by Google for real estate deals, will contribute $1.16 billion over the course of the lease, while reducing the government agency’s maintenance and operation costs by $6.3 million annually.  The best part of the press release is this quote from NASA Administrator Charles Bolden: “As NASA expands its presence in space, we are making strides to reduce our footprint here on Earth,” he says.  NASA and the U.S. General Services Administration (GSA) will continue to own the 1,000 acres of land in Mountain View, Calif., which includes Hangars One, Two, and Three, an airfield flight operations building, two runways, and a private golf course. But for all intents and purposes, they will be handing over operations to Google through Planetary Ventures.",

As part of the lease, Google will take over operations of the airfield while the U.S. government retains ownership of the land.  In a press release, NASA announced that Planetary Ventures LLC, a shell organization operated by Google for real estate deals, will contribute $1.16 billion over the course of the lease, while reducing the government agency’s maintenance and operation costs by $6.3 million annually.  The best part of the press release is this quote from NASA Administrator Charles Bolden: “As NASA expands its presence in space, we are making strides to reduce our footprint here on Earth,” he says.  NASA and the U.S. General Services Administration (GSA) will continue to own the 1,000 acres of land in Mountain View, Calif., which includes Hangars One, Two, and Three, an airfield flight operations building, two runways, and a private golf course. But for all intents and purposes, they will be handing over operations to Google through Planetary Ventures.  The deal was finalized after Google won the right to negotiate the lease earlier in the spring. Under its initial proposal, Google agreed to “rehabilitate and maintain the historic integrity of Hangar One and the Shenandoah Plaza Historic District.”  It will be doing that and more. According to the press release, Planetary Ventures will invest more than $200 million into the property over and above the cost of the lease.  In addition to refurbishing Hangar One, the company will also be rehabbing Hangars Two and Three, operating the airfield “in accordance with the Programmatic Environmental Impact Statement for public and private use,” and creating an educational facility open to the public to teach them about the site and local tech advancements in Silicon Valley.  The firm will also assume operations of the site “following the finalization of a joint plan with NASA, the federal Environmental Protection Agency and California Regional Water Quality Control Board.”  According to the press release, after renovating Moffett Airfield Google will use the site as the home for its own advanced research facilities.  Once renovations are complete, Hangar One will again be home to high-tech innovation as Planetary Ventures begins using the historic facility for research, development, assembly and testing in the areas of space exploration, aviation, rover/robotics and other emerging technologies.

Surprisingly, most people do not—at least not literally. And if you believe the thoughts that enter your head while you sleep actually mean something, this may suggest we’re shockingly content.  MORE Lights Out: Hurricane Knocks Out Power in Bermuda NBC News Sick, Cured, Quarantined: Where Do America's Ebola Victims Stand? NBC News This Week in Schadenfreude: All Governors Edition NBC News These Engagement Photos Are (Almost) Too Awkward To Put In A Frame Huffington Post Paul Anthony Jones: An A to Z of Noah Webster's Finest Forgotten Words Huffington Post Dream analysts say that winning the lotto or a boat, or getting a bonus aren’t even among the top 50 most common thoughts in slumber. Money is nowhere to be found on a state-by-state chart of popular dream symbols. The dream map is dominated by things like “family” in Texas, “cats” in New York, “pigs” in Nebraska, and “sex” in perhaps the most honest states Missouri and New Hampshire.  We each have three to nine dreams per night, and most of us think about money everyday. Yet up and down the list of most common nighttime visions are things like dancing, school, guns, drugs, movies, and food. Nothing about greenbacks. Zilch. “This shows that people place more importance on the quality of their real happiness,” says dream expert Anna-Karin Bjorklund, author of Dream Guidance. “If you never dream about money, chances are your happiness is not related to feeling powerful or having the means to acquire material possessions.”  That’s good, right? Our subconscious is telling us that our pets and friends and experiences are what we really care about—even if we’re carrying a credit card balance and haven’t earned a decent raise in five years. To a degree this confirms much of what polls have shown since the Great Recession: a broad rediscovery of basic values and things that money can’t buy.  But before we congratulate ourselves on being phenomenally high-minded, we need to dig a little deeper. For one thing, materialism creeps onto the dream list in the form of “beach house” in Alabama; in the fourth richest state in America, Connecticut, “shopping” and “malls” make the top-five list. “Cruise ship” sneaks onto the list in Florida.  Besides, dreams are rarely literal—and thankfully so because on the list of popular dream subjects we find cheating, adultery, cemetery, and murder. If you dream about doors opening or being given the keys to an important room—that may be dreaming about a cash windfall, says dream expert Kelly Sullivan Walden, author of It’s All in Your Dreams. And, she says, “If you’re stressed about money in your waking life, you might find yourself dreaming of a leaky faucet, animals fighting over food, or your teeth falling out.”  Got that? How you view whatever you are dreaming is far more important than the dream itself. “If you have a dream where someone is stealing your vegetables, this could indicate that you feel what you’ve been planting has been taken away,” says Bjorklund. According to dream expert Lauri Loewenberg, author of Dream On It, financial stress also shows up in dreams as:  Drowning (debt) Bleeding (savings disappearing) Falling (diminishing financial security) Getting lost (directionless career) Calling 911 but no one answers (poor financial advise) “Dreams are symbolic and speak to us in metaphors,” says Loewenberg. “If you want to look for your dreams to help you with your financial situation, they will, but they may not use money to get the message across.” So maybe a good deal of our subconscious nighttime adventures are about money after all. We just don’t know it",
