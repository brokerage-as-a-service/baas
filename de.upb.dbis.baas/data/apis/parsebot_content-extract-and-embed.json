He was supposed to be wearing a Virginia Tech hat, polo, tube socks and tennis shoes, because that\\u2019s what he always wore.\\nHe was supposed to have driven from Roanoke with his dad \\u2014 his eternal seat mate \\u2014 and met up with best friends Zach Barefoot, Allen Bowman and Tyler Perry. They were supposed to be groomsmen in his wedding next July.\\nAll five die-hard Hokie fans graduated from Virginia Tech and weren\\u2019t going to miss one of the most anticipated games of college football\\u2019s opening weekend with No. 1 Ohio State coming to town Monday. Especially not after they witnessed the upset last season together in Columbus, Ohio. After Tech pulled off that victory, all five men met outside Ohio Stadium and jumped around in a group hug \\u2014 even 72-year-old Buddy.\\nWard started a countdown to this game as soon as the Buckeyes won the national championship on Jan. 12. Random messages like \\u201c72 days\\u201d would come through in their 3-year-old group text at any given moment.\\nBut as kickoff drew closer, Barefoot, Bowman and Perry weren\\u2019t sure they could attend the game. Only last week they were pallbearers at Ward\\u2019s funeral.\\nWard, a 27-year-old television cameraman, and 24-year-old reporter Alison Parker were shot to death by a former co-worker while filming a live interview for news station WDBJ-7 in Roanoke on Aug. 26. Virginia Tech and Ohio State are wearing helmet stickers bearing the victims\\u2019 initials.\\nBarefoot said he knew he had to go to the game when the Hokies announced they\\u2019d be honoring his friend. There will also be a moment of silence before the national anthem.\\n\\u201cIt\\u2019s hard to know what to do,\\u201d said Bowman, who has been Ward\\u2019s best friend since he was a child. \\u201cIt\\u2019s a weird day.\\u201d\\nWard was an avid college sports fan. His dad went to Virginia Tech, and he enrolled in the fall of 2007, only a few months after a mass shooting on campus. When ESPN College GameDay came to Blacksburg that football season, he spent the night outside to be first in line.

When I first started, I dropped a cushion right next to my bed so I would trip over it when I woke up and trip over it when I slept. Formally dedicating a space, even if it is a small corner, helps a lot when you are first trying to establish a discipline.\\n(2) Dedicating a time. When I first started out, I was a night owl. I still am; but a lot of the night owl thing comes from -- you guessed it -- procrastinating on sleep. So I formally dedicated the time right before bed for practice; that, no matter how late, how tired, how fuzzy I was, I was going to sit before I crawled into bed. (A year or two in, I naturally shifted to a morning practice; by then, I feel off if I didn't practice something each day).\\n(3) Gamification worked well for me, though beware going to the extreme. Eventually, one of the things you start stripping away from your mind is responding to the reward\\/punishment triggers. I used a streak calendar. I took page from Kickstarter. I knew that I have a tendency to go overboard in excitement and then try to do as much the next day, fail, feel ashamed\\/guilty about failing, and the dropping off from the practice. So I would have three levels of practice:\\nThe nominal practice time. In the beginning that was 5 minutes. I might not be able to do 10, or 20, but how hard it is to do \\\"just\\\" 5 minutes right before bed?\\nStretch goals: if I went further, I'd consider it a stretch goal. Completely optional. In other words, the next day, the practice goal still resets to my nominal goal. If it happens I reach that stretch goal, then that's ok, but it's ok if I didn't. (If you practice correctly, you would know that there are a lot of things that arises from waiting to achieve stretch goals -- anxiety, shame, guilt, etc. the usual suspects).\\nToken effort: over time (months), I started ratcheting up my nominal practice to longer and longer lengths of time. I tend to do it when I'm regularly hitting stretch goals effortlessly. However, I left room to be lazy. I allowed myself a \\\"token effort\\\", the absolute minimum I can do. It's set around 5 minutes. (These days, \\\"token effort\\\" has more to do with the quality of my mindfulness rather than length of time). I knew early on that, just like stretch goals, some days ... my mind is tricking me into persuading me into skipping for the day, and I counter with \\\"well, why not just do a token effort\\\". Then when I do it, end up going past the token effort and it turns into a regular sit length.\\n(4) Other side of gamification -- social cues. (Ever read a book called \\\"The Talent Code\\\"?

He was supposed to be wearing a Virginia Tech hat, polo, tube socks and tennis shoes, because that\\u2019s what he always wore.\\nHe was supposed to have driven from Roanoke with his dad \\u2014 his eternal seat mate \\u2014 and met up with best friends Zach Barefoot, Allen Bowman and Tyler Perry. They were supposed to be groomsmen in his wedding next July.\\nAll five die-hard Hokie fans graduated from Virginia Tech and weren\\u2019t going to miss one of the most anticipated games of college football\\u2019s opening weekend with No. 1 Ohio State coming to town Monday. Especially not after they witnessed the upset last season together in Columbus, Ohio. After Tech pulled off that victory, all five men met outside Ohio Stadium and jumped around in a group hug \\u2014 even 72-year-old Buddy.\\nWard started a countdown to this game as soon as the Buckeyes won the national championship on Jan. 12. Random messages like \\u201c72 days\\u201d would come through in their 3-year-old group text at any given moment.\\nBut as kickoff drew closer, Barefoot, Bowman and Perry weren\\u2019t sure they could attend the game. Only last week they were pallbearers at Ward\\u2019s funeral.\\nWard, a 27-year-old television cameraman, and 24-year-old reporter Alison Parker were shot to death by a former co-worker while filming a live interview for news station WDBJ-7 in Roanoke on Aug. 26. Virginia Tech and Ohio State are wearing helmet stickers bearing the victims\\u2019 initials.\\nBarefoot said he knew he had to go to the game when the Hokies announced they\\u2019d be honoring his friend. There will also be a moment of silence before the national anthem.\\n\\u201cIt\\u2019s hard to know what to do,\\u201d said Bowman, who has been Ward\\u2019s best friend since he was a child. \\u201cIt\\u2019s a weird day.\\u201d\\nWard was an avid college sports fan. His dad went to Virginia Tech, and he enrolled in the fall of 2007, only a few months after a mass shooting on campus. When ESPN College GameDay came to Blacksburg that football season, he spent the night outside to be first in line. When GameDay came another time for basketball, he painted his whole body and dragged his non-superfan friends with him.\\n\\u201cHe led the charge,\\u201d Bowman said. \\u201cHe brought out the fun in me. In everybody.\\u201d\\nWard almost always wore Virginia Tech gear, even after he graduated in 2011, especially a favorite white hat.\\n\\u201cHis mom had to steal his hat away from him just to wash it because it smelled so bad,\\u201d Bowman said, laughing. \\u201cIn college when he would come home for the weekend, she would sneak into his room, grab his hat from the side table and wash it and then put it back. But he\\u2019d be so mad because she washed it. Then they finally gave him a new hat three years ago, and they had to put his old hat in a glass case in their house.\\n\\u201cEveryone knew him with that hat.\\u201d\\nWard was buried last week dressed in a white Tech polo, his casket was draped with Hokie orange and maroon flowers. During visitation, the famous hat came back, tattered, duct taped, sorority pin and all.\\nWard loved sports, though he couldn\\u2019t really play them because he had bad joints. While in college, he wouldn\\u2019t be left out of his friend\\u2019s flag football games, finding a way to participate.\\n\\u201cHe\\u2019d dress up like defensive coordinator Bud Foster and just stand on the sidelines to be part of it,\\u201d Barefoot said. \\u201cHe had the little arm band for calling plays. It was ridiculous. Nobody paid attention to him, but he just wanted to be out there with us. He knew it was stupid, but he embraced being weird.\\u201d\\nWard worked the morning shift at WDBJ, so every game day he\\u2019d call and wake up his friends at 6 a.m. just to scream something like \\u201cGo Tech!\\u201d\\n\\u201cThat was his baby, Virginia Tech football,\\u201d Barefoot said.\\nIt didn\\u2019t matter if the Hokies were having a bad season. Ward was the \\u201ceternal optimist,\\u201d Bowman said.\\n\\u201cThe grass was always gonna be greener next season,\\u201d Barefoot said. \\u201cWe would do the complaining and he\\u2019d be like, \\u2018Boys, it\\u2019s not like it\\u2019s 1985.\\u2019 We\\u2019d be like, \\u2018Adam you weren\\u2019t even born yet!\\u2019 And he\\u2019d go, \\u2018We sat through enough of those seasons with one loss.\\u2019 And I\\u2019m like, \\u2018You didn\\u2019t physically sit through those seasons. There\\u2019s no we in this scenario!\\u2019\\u201d\\nWard didn\\u2019t care about having good seats. He always wanted to sit in the end zone with his dad so he could see the offensive linemen open holes and receivers run routes. \\u201cHe just wanted to see the intricacies of the game,\\u201d Bowman said.\\nThough Ward\\u2019s worn joints prevented him from jumping up and down for Tech\\u2019s \\u201cEnter Sandman\\u201d field entrance, Bowman couldn\\u2019t recall a time when his friend wasn\\u2019t hoarse the day after a game.\\nThough attending their first game without Ward feels unnatural and painful, his friends said the first time they will feel normalcy in the wake of Ward\\u2019s murder is when they walk into Lane stadium. \\u201cYou switch from I\\u2019ve never wanted to win a game so bad to not caring at all about the score,\\u201d Barefoot said. \\u201cBut Adam wanted this one bad.\\u201d\\nBowman added, \\u201cIt\\u2019s kind of weird being here. The people and the place itself is kind of strange because we have so many memories with Adam. It\\u2019s just weird.\\u201d\\nSection 510, row G, seats 1 and 2 weren\\u2019t going to be empty Monday night.

I don't count that because it's not an instant fix, it's the work I put into getting the fix, which is solving my problem and seeing my program work.<\\/p>\\n<p>I'm tempted to start consuming the internet solely through my kindle (again, just the instant fix sites: hn, reddit, facebook). It would slow my consumption way down and I'd only be able to use it when I'm not working. But, I need to find a way to stick to that and not also read HN and Reddit while I'm at the work computer. The only tried and true solution I've found for that is to get an accountability buddy. I tried to do that once in person with co-workers (I offered to give them $20 if they can catch me consuming caffeine), but in the end they were uncomfortable taking my money.

I still am; but a lot of the night owl thing comes from -- you guessed it -- procrastinating on sleep. So I formally dedicated the time right before bed for practice; that, no matter how late, how tired, how fuzzy I was, I was going to sit before I crawled into bed.

I might not be able to do 10, or 20, but how hard it is to do \\\"just\\\" 5 minutes right before bed?\\nStretch goals: if I went further, I'd consider it a stretch goal. Completely optional.

(If you practice correctly, you would know that there are a lot of things that arises from waiting to achieve stretch goals -- anxiety, shame, guilt, etc. the usual suspects).\\nToken effort: over time (months), I started ratcheting up my nominal practice to longer and longer lengths of time. I tend to do it when I'm regularly hitting stretch goals effortlessly. However, I left room to be lazy. I allowed myself a \\\"token effort\\\", the absolute minimum I can do. It's set around 5 minutes. (These days, \\\"token effort\\\" has more to do with the quality of my mindfulness rather than length of time).
