        "body": "[{\"name\":\"Jane Goodall: What separates us from chimpanzees?\",\"transcript\":\"Good morning everyone. First of all, it\\\\'s been fantastic being here over these past few days. And secondly, I feel it\\\\'s a great honor to kind of wind up this extraordinary gathering of people, these amazing talks that we\\\\'ve had. I feel that I\\\\'ve fitted in, in many ways, to some of the things that I\\\\'ve heard. I came directly here from the deep, deep tropical rainforest in Ecuador, where I was out -- you could only get there by a plane -- with indigenous people with paint on their faces and parrot feathers on their headdresses, where these people are fighting to try and keep the oil companies, and keep the roads, out of their forests. They\\\\'re fighting to develop their own way of living within the forest in a world that\\\\'s clean, a world that isn\\\\'t contaminated, a world that isn\\\\'t polluted. And what was so amazing to me, and what fits right in with what we\\\\'re all talking about here at TED, is that there, right in the middle of this rainforest, was some solar panels -- the first in that part of Ecuador -- and that was mainly to bring water up by pump so that the women wouldn\\\\'t have to go down. The water was cleaned, but because they got a lot of batteries, they were able to store a lot of electricity. So every house -- and there were, I think, eight houses in this little community -- could have light for, I think it was about half an hour each evening. And there is the Chief, in all his regal finery, with a laptop computer. (Laughter) And this man, he has been outside, but he\\\\'s gone back, and he was saying, \\\\\\\"You know, we have suddenly jumped into a whole new era, and we didn\\\\'t even know about the white man 50 years ago, and now here we are with laptop computers, and there are some things we want to learn from the modern world. We want to know about health care. We want to know about what other people do -- we\\\\'re interested in it. And we want to learn other languages. We want to know English and French and perhaps Chinese, and we\\\\'re good at languages.\\\\\\\" So there he is with his little laptop computer, but fighting against the might of the pressures -- because of the debt, the foreign debt of Ecuador -- fighting the pressure of World Bank, IMF, and of course the people who want to exploit the forests and take out the oil. And so, coming directly from there to here. But, of course, my real field of expertise lies in an even different kind of civilization -- I can\\\\'t really call it a civilization. A different way of life, a different being. We\\\\'ve talked earlier -- this wonderful talk by Wade Davis about the different cultures of the humans around the world -- but the world is not composed only of human beings; there are also other animal beings. And I propose to bring into this TED conference, as I always do around the world, the voice of the animal kingdom. Too often we just see a few slides, or a bit of film, but these beings have voices that mean something. And so, I want to give you a greeting, as from a chimpanzee in the forests of Tanzania -- Ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh! (Applause) I\\\\'ve been studying chimpanzees in Tanzania since 1960. During that time, there have been modern technologies that have really transformed the way that field biologists do their work. For example, for the first time, a few years ago, by simply collecting little fecal samples we were able to have them analyzed -- to have DNA profiling done -- so for the first time, we actually know which male chimps are the fathers of each individual infant. Because the chimps have a very promiscuous mating society. So this opens up a whole new avenue of research. And we use GSI -- geographic whatever it is, GSI -- to determine the range of the chimps. And we\\\\'re using -- you can see that I\\\\'m not really into this kind of stuff -- but we\\\\'re using satellite imagery to look at the deforestation in the area. And of course, there\\\\'s developments in infrared, so you can watch animals at night, and equipment for recording by video, and tape recording is getting lighter and better. So in many, many ways, we can do things today that we couldn\\\\'t do when I began in 1960. Especially when chimpanzees, and other animals with large brains, are studied in captivity, modern technology is helping us to search for the upper levels of cognition in some of these non-human animals. So that we know today, they\\\\'re capable of performances that would have been thought absolutely impossible by science when I began. I think the chimpanzee in captivity who is the most skilled in intellectual performance is one called Ai in Japan -- her name means love -- and she has a wonderfully sensitive partner working with her. She loves her computer -- she\\\\'ll leave her big group, and her running water, and her trees and everything. And she\\\\'ll come in to sit at this computer -- it\\\\'s like a video game for a kid; she\\\\'s hooked. She\\\\'s 28, by the way, and she does things with her computer screen and a touch pad that she can do faster than most humans. She does very complex tasks, and I haven\\\\'t got time to go into them, but the amazing thing about this female is she doesn\\\\'t like making mistakes. If she has a bad run, and her score isn\\\\'t good, she\\\\'ll come and reach up and tap on the glass -- because she can\\\\'t see the experimenter -- which is asking to have another go. And her concentration -- she\\\\'s already concentrated hard for 20 minutes or so, and now she wants to do it all over again, just for the satisfaction of having done it better. And the food is not important -- she does get a tiny reward, like one raisin for a correct response -- but she will do it for nothing, if you tell her beforehand. So here we are, a chimpanzee using a computer. Chimpanzees, gorillas, orangutans also learn human sign language. But the point is that when I was first in Gombe in 1960 -- I remember so well, so vividly, as though it was yesterday -- the first time, when I was going through the vegetation, the chimpanzees were still running away from me, for the most part, although some were a little bit acclimatized -- and I saw this dark shape, hunched over a termite mound, and I peered with my binoculars. It was, fortunately, one adult male whom I\\\\'d named David Greybeard -- and by the way, science at that time was telling me that I shouldn\\\\'t name the chimps; they should all have numbers; that was more scientific. Anyway, David Greybeard -- and I saw that he was picking little pieces of grass and using them to fish termites from their underground nest. And not only that -- he would sometimes pick a leafy twig and strip the leaves -- modifying an object to make it suitable for a specific purpose -- the beginning of tool-making. The reason this was so exciting and such a breakthrough is at that time, it was thought that humans, and only humans, used and made tools. When I was at school, we were defined as man, the toolmaker. So that when Louis Leakey, my mentor, heard this news, he said, \\\\\\\"Ah, we must now redefine \\\\'man,\\\\' redefine \\\\'tool,\\\\' or accept chimpanzees as humans.\\\\\\\" (Laughter) We now know that at Gombe alone, there are nine different ways in which chimpanzees use different objects for different purposes. Moreover, we know that in different parts of Africa, wherever chimps have been studied, there are completely different tool-using behaviors. And because it seems that these patterns are passed from one generation to the next, through observation, imitation and practice -- that is a definition of human culture. What we find is that over these 40-odd years that I and others have been studying chimpanzees and the other great apes, and, as I say, other mammals with complex brains and social systems, we have found that after all, there isn\\\\'t a sharp line dividing humans from the rest of the animal kingdom. It\\\\'s a very wuzzy line. It\\\\'s getting wuzzier all the time as we find animals doing things that we, in our arrogance, used to think was just human. The chimps -- there\\\\'s no time to discuss their fascinating lives -- but they have this long childhood, five years of suckling and sleeping with the mother, and then another three, four or five years of emotional dependence on her, even when the next child is born. The importance of learning in that time, when behavior is flexible -- and there\\\\'s an awful lot to learn in chimpanzee society. The long-term affectionate supportive bonds that develop throughout this long childhood with the mother, with the brothers and sisters, and which can last through a lifetime, which may be up to 60 years. They can actually live longer than 60 in captivity, so we\\\\'ve only done 40 years in the wild so far. And we find chimps are capable of true compassion and altruism. We find in their non-verbal communication -- this is very rich -- they have a lot of sounds, which they use in different circumstances, but they also use touch, posture, gesture, and what do they do? They kiss; they embrace; they hold hands. They pat one another on the back; they swagger; they shake their fist -- the kind of things that we do, and they do them in the same kind of context. They have very sophisticated cooperation. Sometimes they hunt -- not that often, but when they hunt, they show sophisticated cooperation, and they share the prey. We find that they show emotions, similar to -- maybe sometimes the same -- as those that we describe in ourselves as happiness, sadness, fear, despair. They know mental as well as physical suffering. And I don\\\\'t have time to go into the information that will prove some of these things to you, save to say that there are very bright students, in the best universities, studying emotions in animals, studying personalities in animals. We know that chimpanzees and some other creatures can recognize themselves in mirrors -- \\\\\\\"self\\\\\\\" as opposed to \\\\\\\"other.\\\\\\\" They have a sense of humor, and these are the kind of things which traditionally have been thought of as human prerogatives. But this teaches us a new respect -- and it\\\\'s a new respect not only for the chimpanzees, I suggest, but some of the other amazing animals with whom we share this planet. Once we\\\\'re prepared to admit that after all, we\\\\'re not the only beings with personalities, minds and above all feelings, and then we start to think about ways we use and abuse so many other sentient, sapient creatures on this planet, it really gives cause for deep shame, at least for me. So, the sad thing is that these chimpanzees -- who\\\\'ve perhaps taught us, more than any other creature, a little humility -- are in the wild, disappearing very fast. They\\\\'re disappearing for the reasons that all of you in this room know only too well. The deforestation, the growth of human populations, needing more land. They\\\\'re disappearing because some timber companies go in with clear-cutting. They\\\\'re disappearing in the heart of their range in Africa because the big multinational logging companies have come in and made roads -- as they want to do in Ecuador and other parts where the forests remain untouched -- to take out oil or timber. And this has led in Congo basin, and other parts of the world, to what is known as the bush-meat trade. This means that although for hundreds, perhaps thousands of years, people have lived in those forests, or whatever habitat it is, in harmony with their world, just killing the animals they need for themselves and their families -- now, suddenly, because of the roads, the hunters can go in from the towns. They shoot everything, every single thing that moves that\\\\'s bigger than a small rat; they sun-dry it or smoke it. And now they\\\\'ve got transport; they take it on the logging trucks or the mining trucks into the towns where they sell it. And people will pay more for bush-meat, as it\\\\'s called, than for domestic meat -- it\\\\'s culturally preferred. And it\\\\'s not sustainable, and the huge logging camps in the forest are now demanding meat, so the Pygmy hunters in the Congo basin who\\\\'ve lived there with their wonderful way of living for so many hundreds of years are now corrupted. They\\\\'re given weapons; they shoot for the logging camps; they get money. Their culture is being destroyed, along with the animals upon whom they depend. So, when the logging camp moves, there\\\\'s nothing left. We talked already about the loss of human cultural diversity, and I\\\\'ve seen it happening with my own eyes. And the grim picture in Africa -- I love Africa, and what do we see in Africa? We see deforestation; we see the desert spreading; we see massive hunger; we see disease and we see population growth in areas where there are more people living on a certain piece of land than the land can possibly support, and they\\\\'re too poor to buy food from elsewhere. Were the people that we heard about yesterday, on the Easter Island, who cut down their last tree -- were they stupid? Didn\\\\'t they know what was happening? Of course, but if you\\\\'ve seen the crippling poverty in some of these parts of the world it isn\\\\'t a question of \\\\\\\"Let\\\\'s leave the tree for tomorrow.\\\\\\\" \\\\\\\"How am I going to feed my family today? Maybe I can get just a few dollars from this last tree which will keep us going a little bit longer, and then we\\\\'ll pray that something will happen to save us from the inevitable end.\\\\\\\" So, this is a pretty grim picture. The one thing we have, which makes us so different from chimpanzees or other living creatures, is this sophisticated spoken language -- a language with which we can tell children about things that aren\\\\'t here. We can talk about the distant past, plan for the distant future, discuss ideas with each other, so that the ideas can grow from the accumulated wisdom of a group. We can do it by talking to each other; we can do it through video; we can do it through the written word. And we are abusing this great power we have to be wise stewards, and we\\\\'re destroying the world. In the developed world, in a way, it\\\\'s worse, because we have so much access to knowledge of the stupidity of what we\\\\'re doing. Do you know, we\\\\'re bringing little babies into a world where, in many places, the water is poisoning them? And the air is harming them, and the food that\\\\'s grown from the contaminated land is poisoning them. And that\\\\'s not just in the far-away developing world; that\\\\'s everywhere. Do you know we all have about 50 chemicals in our bodies we didn\\\\'t have about 50 years ago? And so many of these diseases, like asthma and certain kinds of cancers, are on the increase around places where our filthy toxic waste is dumped. We\\\\'re harming ourselves around the world, as well as harming the animals, as well as harming nature herself -- Mother Nature, that brought us into being; Mother Nature, where I believe we need to spend time, where there\\\\'s trees and flowers and birds for our good psychological development. And yet, there are hundreds and hundreds of children in the developed world who never see nature, because they\\\\'re growing up in concrete and all they know is virtual reality, with no opportunity to go and lie in the sun, or in the forest, with the dappled sun-specks coming down from the canopy above. As I was traveling around the world, you know, I had to leave the forest -- that\\\\'s where I love to be. I had to leave these fascinating chimpanzees for my students and field staff to continue studying because, finding they dwindled from about two million 100 years ago to about 150,000 now, I knew I had to leave the forest to do what I could to raise awareness around the world. And the more I talked about the chimpanzees\\\\' plight, the more I realized the fact that everything\\\\'s interconnected, and the problems of the developing world so often stem from the greed of the developed world, and everything was joining together, and making -- not sense, hope lies in sense, you said -- it\\\\'s making a nonsense. How can we do it? Somebody said that yesterday. And as I was traveling around, I kept meeting young people who\\\\'d lost hope. They were feeling despair, they were feeling, \\\\\\\"Well, it doesn\\\\'t matter what we do; eat, drink and be merry, for tomorrow we die. Everything is hopeless -- we\\\\'re always being told so by the media.\\\\\\\" And then I met some who were angry, and anger that can turn to violence, and we\\\\'re all familiar with that. And I have three little grandchildren, and when some of these students would say to me at high school or university, they\\\\'d say, \\\\\\\"We\\\\'re angry,\\\\\\\" or \\\\\\\"We\\\\'re filled with despair, because we feel you\\\\'ve compromised our future, and there\\\\'s nothing we can do about it.\\\\\\\" And I looked in the eyes of my little grandchildren, and think how much we\\\\'ve harmed this planet since I was their age. I feel this deep shame, and that\\\\'s why in 1991 in Tanzania, I started a program that\\\\'s called Roots and Shoots. There\\\\'s little brochures all around outside, and if any of you have anything to do with children and care about their future, I beg that you pick up that brochure. And Roots and Shoots is a program for hope. Roots make a firm foundation. Shoots seem tiny, but to reach the sun they can break through brick walls. See the brick walls as all the problems that we\\\\'ve inflicted on this planet. Then, you see, it is a message of hope. Hundreds and thousands of young people around the world can break through, and can make this a better world. And the most important message of Roots and Shoots is that every single individual makes a difference. Every individual has a role to play. Every one of us impacts the world around us everyday, and you scientists know that you can\\\\'t actually -- even if you stay in bed all day, you\\\\'re breathing oxygen and giving out CO2, and probably going to the loo, and things like that -- you\\\\'re making a difference in the world. So, the Roots and Shoots program involves youth in three kinds of projects. And these are projects to make the world around them a better place. One project to show care and concern for your own human community. One for animals, including domestic animals -- and I have to say, I learned everything I know about animal behavior even before I got to Gombe and the chimps from my dog, Rusty, who was my childhood companion. And the third kind of project: something for the local environment. So what the kids do depends first of all, how old are they -- and we go now from pre-school right through university. It\\\\'s going to depend whether they\\\\'re inner-city or rural. It\\\\'s going to depend if they\\\\'re wealthy or impoverished. It\\\\'s going to depend which part, say, of America they\\\\'re in. We\\\\'re in every state now, and the problems in Florida are different from the problems in New York. It\\\\'s going to depend on which country they\\\\'re in -- and we\\\\'re already in 60-plus countries, with about 5,000 active groups -- and there are groups all over the place that I keep hearing about that I\\\\'ve never even heard of, because the kids are taking the program and spreading it themselves. Why? Because they\\\\'re buying into it, and they\\\\'re the ones who get to decide what they\\\\'re going to do. It isn\\\\'t something that their parents tell them, or their teachers tell them. That\\\\'s effective, but if they decide themselves, \\\\\\\"We want to clean this river and put the fish back that used to be there. We want to clear away the toxic soil from this area and have an organic garden. We want to go and spend time with the old people and hear their stories and record their oral histories. We want to go and work in a dog shelter. We want to learn about animals. We want ... \\\\\\\" You know, it goes on and on, and this is very hopeful for me. As I travel around the world 300 days a year, everywhere there\\\\'s a group of Roots and Shoots of different ages. Everywhere there are children with shining eyes saying, \\\\\\\"Look at the difference we\\\\'ve made.\\\\\\\" And now comes the technology into it, because with this new way of communicating electronically these kids can communicate with each other around the world. And if anyone is interested to help us, we\\\\'ve got so many ideas but we need help -- we need help to create the right kind of system that will help these young people to communicate their excitement. But also -- and this is so important -- to communicate their despair, to say, \\\\\\\"We\\\\'ve tried this and it doesn\\\\'t work, and what shall we do?\\\\\\\" And then, lo and behold, there\\\\'s another group answering these kids who may be in America, or maybe this is a group in Israel, saying, \\\\\\\"Yeah, you did it a little bit wrong. This is how you should do it.\\\\\\\" The philosophy is very simple. We do not believe in violence. No violence, no bombs, no guns. That\\\\'s not the way to solve problems. Violence leads to violence, at least in my view. So how do we solve? The tools for solving the problems are knowledge and understanding. Know the facts, but see how they fit in the big picture. Hard work and persistence --don\\\\'t give up -- and love and compassion leading to respect for all life. How many more minutes? Two, one? Chris Anderson: One -- one to two. Jane Goodall: Two, two, I\\\\'m going to take two. (Laughter) Are you going to come and drag me off? (Laughter) Anyway -- so basically, Roots and Shoots is beginning to change young people\\\\'s lives. It\\\\'s what I\\\\'m devoting most of my energy to. And I believe that a group like this can have a very major impact, not just because you can share technology with us, but because so many of you have children. And if you take this program out, and give it to your children, they have such a good opportunity to go out and do good, because they\\\\'ve got parents like you. And it\\\\'s been so clear how much you all care about trying to make this world a better place. It\\\\'s very encouraging. But the kids do ask me -- and this won\\\\'t take more than two minutes, I promise -- the kids say, \\\\\\\"Dr. Jane, do you really have hope for the future? You travel, you see all these horrible things happening.\\\\\\\" Firstly, the human brain -- I don\\\\'t need to say anything about that. Now that we know what the problems are around the world, human brains like yours are rising to solve those problems. And we\\\\'ve talked a lot about that. Secondly, the resilience of nature. We can destroy a river, and we can bring it back to life. We can see a whole area desolated, and it can be brought back to bloom again, with time or a little help. And thirdly, the last speaker talked about -- or the speaker before last, talked about the indomitable human spirit. We are surrounded by the most amazing people who do things that seem to be absolutely impossible. Nelson Mandela -- I take a little piece of limestone from Robben Island Prison, where he labored for 27 years, and came out with so little bitterness, he could lead his people from the horror of apartheid without a bloodbath. Even after the 11th of September -- and I was in New York and I felt the fear -- nevertheless, there was so much human courage, so much love and so much compassion. And then as I went around the country after that and felt the fear -- the fear that was leading to people feeling they couldn\\\\'t worry about the environment any more, in case they seemed not to be patriotic -- and I was trying to encourage them, somebody came up with a little quotation from Mahatma Gandhi, \\\\\\\"If you look back through human history, you see that every evil regime has been overcome by good.\\\\\\\" And just after that a woman brought me this little bell, and I want to end on this note. She said, \\\\\\\"If you\\\\'re talking about hope and peace, ring this. This bell is made from metal from a defused landmine, from the killing fields of Pol Pot -- one of the most evil regimes in human history -- where people are now beginning to put their lives back together after the regime has crumbled. So, yes, there is hope, and where is the hope? Is it out there with the politicians? It\\\\'s in our hands. It\\\\'s in your hands and my hands and those of our children. It\\\\'s really up to us. We\\\\'re the ones who can make a difference. If we lead lives where we consciously leave the lightest possible ecological footprints, if we buy the things that are ethical for us to buy and don\\\\'t buy the things that are not, we can change the world overnight. Thank you.\",\"youTubeID\":\"51z7WRDjOjM\"},{\"name\":\"Roger Ebert: Remaking my voice\",\"transcript\":\"Roger Ebert: These are my words, but this is not my voice. This is Alex, the best computer voice I\\\\'ve been able to find, which comes as standard equipment on every Macintosh. For most of my life, I never gave a second thought to my ability to speak. It was like breathing. In those days, I was living in a fool\\\\'s paradise. After surgeries for cancer took away my ability to speak, eat or drink, I was forced to enter this virtual world in which a computer does some of my living for me. For several days now, we have enjoyed brilliant and articulate speakers here at TED. I used to be able to talk like that. Maybe I wasn\\\\'t as smart, but I was at least as talkative. I want to devote my talk today to the act of speaking itself, and how the act of speaking or not speaking is tied so indelibly to one\\\\'s identity as to force the birth of a new person when it is taken away. However, I\\\\'ve found that listening to a computer voice for any great length of time can be monotonous. So I\\\\'ve decided to recruit some of my TED friends to read my words aloud for me. I will start with my wife, Chaz. Chaz Ebert: It was Chaz who stood by my side through three attempts to reconstruct my jaw and restore my ability to speak. Going into the first surgery for a recurrence of salivary cancer in 2006, I expected to be out of the hospital in time to return to my movie review show, \\\\'Ebert and Roeper at the Movies.\\\\' I had pre-taped enough shows to get me through six weeks of surgery and recuperation. The doctors took a fibula bone from my leg and some tissue from my shoulder to fashion into a new jaw. My tongue, larynx and vocal cords were still healthy and unaffected. (Laughter) (Laughter) CE: I was optimistic, and all was right with the world. The first surgery was a great success. I saw myself in the mirror and I looked pretty good. Two weeks later, I was ready to return home. I was using my iPod to play the Leonard Cohen song \\\\'I\\\\'m Your Man\\\\' for my doctors and nurses. Suddenly, I had an episode of catastrophic bleeding. My carotid artery had ruptured. Thank God I was still in my hospital room and my doctors were right there. Chaz told me that if that song hadn\\\\'t played for so long, I might have already been in the car, on the way home, and would have died right there and then. So thank you, Leonard Cohen, for saving my life. (Applause) There was a second surgery -- which held up for five or six days and then it also fell apart. And then a third attempt, which also patched me back together pretty well, until it failed. A doctor from Brazil said he had never seen anyone survive a carotid artery rupture. And before I left the hospital, after a year of being hospitalized, I had seven ruptures of my carotid artery. There was no particular day when anyone told me I would never speak again; it just sort of became obvious. Human speech is an ingenious manipulation of our breath within the sound chamber of our mouth and respiratory system. We need to be able to hold and manipulate that breath in order to form sounds. Therefore, the system must be essentially airtight in order to capture air. Because I had lost my jaw, I could no longer form a seal, and therefore my tongue and all of my other vocal equipment was rendered powerless. Dean Ornish: At first for a long time, I wrote messages in notebooks. Then I tried typing words on my laptop and using its built in voice. This was faster, and nobody had to try to read my handwriting. I tried out various computer voices that were available online, and for several months I had a British accent, which Chaz called Sir Lawrence.\\\\\\\" (Laughter) \\\\\\\"It was the clearest I could find. Then Apple released the Alex voice, which was the best I\\\\'d heard. It knew things like the difference between an exclamation point and a question mark. When it saw a period, it knew how to make a sentence sound like it was ending instead of staying up in the air. There are all sorts of html codes you can use to control the timing and inflection of computer voices, and I\\\\'ve experimented with them. For me, they share a fundamental problem: they\\\\'re too slow. When I find myself in a conversational situation, I need to type fast and to jump right in. People don\\\\'t have the time or the patience to wait for me to fool around with the codes for every word or phrase. But what value do we place on the sound of our own voice? How does that affect who you are as a person? When people hear Alex speaking my words, do they experience a disconnect? Does that create a separation or a distance from one person to the next? How did I feel not being able to speak? I felt, and I still feel, a lot of distance from the human mainstream. I\\\\'ve become uncomfortable when I\\\\'m separated from my laptop. Even then, I\\\\'m aware that most people have little patience for my speaking difficulties. So Chaz suggested finding a company that could make a customized voice using my TV show voice from a period of 30 years. At first I was against it. I thought it would be creepy to hear my own voice coming from a computer. There was something comforting about a voice that was not my own. But I decided then to just give it a try. So we contacted a company in Scotland that created personalized computer voices. They\\\\'d never made one from previously-recorded materials. All of their voices had been made by a speaker recording original words in a control booth. But they were willing to give it a try. So I sent them many hours of recordings of my voice, including several audio commentary tracks that I\\\\'d made for movies on DVDs. And it sounded like me, it really did. There was a reason for that; it was me. But it wasn\\\\'t that simple. The tapes from my TV show weren\\\\'t very useful because there were too many other kinds of audio involved -- movie soundtracks, for example, or Gene Siskel arguing with me -- (Laughter) and my words often had a particular emphasis that didn\\\\'t fit into a sentence well enough. I\\\\'ll let you hear a sample of that voice. These are a few of the comments I recorded for use when Chaz and I appeared on the Oprah Winfrey program. And here\\\\'s the voice we call Roger Jr. or Roger 2.0. Roger 2.0: Oprah, I can\\\\'t tell you how great it is to be back on your show. We have been talking for a long time, and now here we are again. This is the first version of my computer voice. It still needs improvement, but at least it sounds like me and not like HAL 9000. When I heard it the first time, it sent chills down my spine. When I type anything, this voice will speak whatever I type. When I read something, it will read in my voice. I have typed these words in advance, as I didn\\\\'t think it would be thrilling to sit here watching me typing. The voice was created by a company in Scotland named CereProc. It makes me feel good that many of the words you are hearing were first spoken while I was commenting on \\\\\\\"Casablanca\\\\\\\" and \\\\\\\"Citizen Kane.\\\\\\\" This is the first voice they\\\\'ve created for an individual. There are several very good voices available for computers, but they all sound like somebody else, while this voice sounds like me. I plan to use it on television, radio and the Internet. People who need a voice should know that most computers already come with built-in speaking systems. Many blind people use them to read pages on the Web to themselves. But I\\\\'ve got to say, in first grade, they said I talked too much, and now I still can. (Laughter) Roger Ebert: As you can hear, it sounds like me, but the words jump up and down. The flow isn\\\\'t natural. The good people in Scotland are still improving my voice, and I\\\\'m optimistic about it. But so far, the Apple Alex voice is the best one I\\\\'ve heard. I wrote a blog about it and actually got a comment from the actor who played Alex. He said he recorded many long hours in various intonations to be used in the voice. A very large sample is needed. John Hunter: All my life I was a motormouth. Now I have spoken my last words, and I don\\\\'t even remember for sure what they were. I feel like the hero of that Harlan Ellison story titled \\\\\\\"I Have No Mouth and I Must Scream.\\\\\\\" On Wednesday, David Christian explained to us what a tiny instant the human race represents in the time-span of the universe. For almost all of its millions and billions of years, there was no life on Earth at all. For almost all the years of life on Earth, there was no intelligent life. Only after we learned to pass knowledge from one generation to the next, did civilization become possible. In cosmological terms, that was about 10 minutes ago. Finally came mankind\\\\'s most advanced and mysterious tool, the computer. That has mostly happened in my lifetime. Some of the famous early computers were being built in my hometown of Urbana, the birthplace of HAL 9000. When I heard the amazing talk by Salman Khan on Wednesday, about the Khan Academy website that teaches hundreds of subjects to students all over the world, I had a flashback. It was about 1960. As a local newspaper reporter still in high school, I was sent over to the computer lab of the University of Illinois to interview the creators of something called PLATO. The initials stood for Programmed Logic for Automated Teaching Operations. This was a computer-assisted instruction system, which in those days ran on a computer named ILLIAC. The programmers said it could assist students in their learning. I doubt, on that day 50 years ago, they even dreamed of what Salman Khan has accomplished. But that\\\\'s not the point. The point is PLATO was only 50 years ago, an instant in time. It continued to evolve and operated in one form or another on more and more sophisticated computers, until only five years ago. I have learned from Wikipedia that, starting with that humble beginning, PLATO established forums, message boards, online testing, email, chat rooms, picture languages, instant messaging, remote screen sharing and multiple-player games. Since the first Web browser was also developed in Urbana, it appears that my hometown in downstate Illinois was the birthplace of much of the virtual, online universe we occupy today. But I\\\\'m not here from the Chamber of Commerce. (Laughter) I\\\\'m here as a man who wants to communicate. All of this has happened in my lifetime. I started writing on a computer back in the 1970s when one of the first Atech systems was installed at the Chicago Sun-Times. I was in line at Radio Shack to buy one of the first Model 100\\\\'s. And when I told the people in the press room at the Academy Awards that they\\\\'d better install some phone lines for Internet connections, they didn\\\\'t know what I was talking about. When I bought my first desktop, it was a DEC Rainbow. Does anybody remember that?\\\\\\\" (Applause) \\\\\\\"The Sun Times sent me to the Cannes Film Festival with a portable computer the size of a suitcase named the Porteram Telebubble. I joined CompuServe when it had fewer numbers than I currently have followers on Twitter. (Laughter) CE: All of this has happened in the blink of an eye. It is unimaginable what will happen next. It makes me incredibly fortunate to live at this moment in history. Indeed, I am lucky to live in history at all, because without intelligence and memory there is no history. For billions of years, the universe evolved completely without notice. Now we live in the age of the Internet, which seems to be creating a form of global consciousness. And because of it, I can communicate as well as I ever could. We are born into a box of time and space. We use words and communication to break out of it and to reach out to others. For me, the Internet began as a useful tool and now has become something I rely on for my actual daily existence. I cannot speak; I can only type so fast. Computer voices are sometimes not very sophisticated, but with my computer, I can communicate more widely than ever before. I feel as if my blog, my email, Twitter and Facebook have given me a substitute for everyday conversation. They aren\\\\'t an improvement, but they\\\\'re the best I can do. They give me a way to speak. Not everybody has the patience of my wife, Chaz. But online, everybody speaks at the same speed. This whole adventure has been a learning experience. Every time there was a surgery that failed, I was left with a little less flesh and bone. Now I have no jaw left at all. While harvesting tissue from both my shoulders, the surgeries left me with back pain and reduced my ability to walk easily. Ironic that my legs are fine, and it\\\\'s my shoulders that slow up my walk. When you see me today, I look like the Phantom of the Opera. But no you don\\\\'t. (Laughter) (Applause) It is human nature to look at someone like me and assume I have lost some of my marbles. People -- (Applause) People talk loudly -- I\\\\'m so sorry. Excuse me. (Applause) People talk loudly and slowly to me. Sometimes they assume I am deaf. There are people who don\\\\'t want to make eye contact. Believe me, he didn\\\\'t mean this as -- anyway, let me just read it. (Laughter) You should never let your wife read something like this. (Laughter) It is human nature to look away from illness. We don\\\\'t enjoy a reminder of our own fragile mortality. That\\\\'s why writing on the Internet has become a lifesaver for me. My ability to think and write have not been affected. And on the Web, my real voice finds expression. I have also met many other disabled people who communicate this way. One of my Twitter friends can type only with his toes. One of the funniest blogs on the Web is written by a friend of mine named Smartass Cripple. (Laughter) Google him and he will make you laugh. All of these people are saying, in one way or another, that what you see is not all you get. So I have not come here to complain. I have much to make me happy and relieved. I seem, for the time being, to be cancer-free. I am writing as well as ever. I am productive. If I were in this condition at any point before a few cosmological instants ago, I would be as isolated as a hermit. I would be trapped inside my head. Because of the rush of human knowledge, because of the digital revolution, I have a voice, and I do not need to scream. RE: Wait. I have one more thing to add. A guy goes into a psychiatrist. The psychiatrist says, \\\\\\\"You\\\\'re crazy.\\\\\\\" The guy says, \\\\\\\"I want a second opinion.\\\\\\\" The psychiatrist says, \\\\\\\"All right, you\\\\'re ugly.\\\\\\\" (Laughter) You all know the test for artificial intelligence -- the Turing test. A human judge has a conversation with a human and a computer. If the judge can\\\\'t tell the machine apart from the human, the machine has passed the test. I now propose a test for computer voices -- the Ebert test. If a computer voice can successfully tell a joke and do the timing and delivery as well as Henny Youngman, then that\\\\'s the voice I want. (Applause)\",\"youTubeID\":\"KNXOVpN8Wgg\"},{\"name\":\"John Doerr: Salvation (and profit) in greentech\",\"transcript\":\"I\\\\'m really scared. I don\\\\'t think we\\\\'re going to make it. Probably by now most of you have seen Al Gore\\\\'s amazing talk. Shortly after I saw that, we had some friends over for dinner with the family. The conversation turned to global warming, and everybody agreed, there\\\\'s a real problem. We\\\\'ve got a climate crisis. So, we went around the table to talk about what we should do. The conversation came to my 15-year-old daughter, Mary. She said, \\\\\\\"I agree with everything that\\\\'s been said. I\\\\'m scared and I\\\\'m angry.\\\\\\\" And then she turned to me and said, \\\\\\\"Dad, your generation created this problem; you\\\\'d better fix it.\\\\\\\" Wow. All the conversation stopped. All the eyes turned to me. (Laughter) I didn\\\\'t know what to say. Kleiner\\\\'s second law is, \\\\\\\"There is a time when panic is the appropriate response.\\\\\\\" (Laughter) And we\\\\'ve reached that time. We cannot afford to underestimate this problem. If we face irreversible and catastrophic consequences, we must act, and we must act decisively. I\\\\'ve got to tell you, for me, everything changed that evening. And so, my partners and I, we set off on this mission to learn more, to try to do much more. So, we mobilized. We got on airplanes. We went to Brazil. We went to China and to India, to Bentonville, Arkansas, to Washington, D.C. and to Sacramento. And so, what I\\\\'d like to do now is to tell you about what we\\\\'ve learned in those journeys. Because the more we learned, the more concerned we grew. You know, my partners at Kleiner and I were compulsive networkers, and so when we see a big problem or an opportunity like avian flu or personalized medicine, we just get together the smartest people we know. For this climate crisis, we assembled a network, really, of superstars, from policy activists to scientists and entrepreneurs and business leaders. Fifty or so of them. And so, I want to tell you about what we\\\\'ve learned in doing that and four lessons I\\\\'ve learned in the last year. The first lesson is that companies are really powerful, and that matters a lot. This is a story about how Wal-Mart went green, and what that means. Two years ago, the CEO, Lee Scott, believed that green is the next big thing, and so Wal-Mart made going green a top priority. They committed that they\\\\'re going to take their existing stores and reduce their energy consumption by 20 percent, and their new stores by 30 percent, and do all that in seven years. The three biggest uses of energy in a store are heating and air conditioning, then lighting, and then refrigeration. So, look what they did. They painted the roofs of all their stores white. They put smart skylights through their stores so they could harvest the daylight and reduce the lighting demands. And, third, they put the refrigerated goods behind closed doors with LED lighting. I mean, why would you try to refrigerate a whole store? These are really simple, smart solutions based on existing technology. Why does Wal-Mart matter? Well, it\\\\'s massive. They\\\\'re the largest private employer in America. They\\\\'re the largest private user of electricity. They have the second-largest vehicle fleet on the road. And they have one of the world\\\\'s most amazing supply chains, 60,000 suppliers. If Wal-Mart were a country, it would be the sixth-largest trading partner with China. And maybe most important, they have a big effect on other companies. When Wal-Mart declares it\\\\'s going to go green and be profitable, it has a powerful impact on other great institutions. So, let me tell you this: when Wal-Mart achieves 20 percent energy reductions, that\\\\'s going to be a very big deal. But I\\\\'m afraid it\\\\'s not enough. We need Wal-Mart and every other company to do the same. The second thing that we learned is that individuals matter, and they matter enormously. I\\\\'ve got another Wal-Mart story for you, OK? Wal-Mart has over 125 million U.S. customers. That\\\\'s a third of the U.S. population. 65 million compact fluorescent light bulbs were sold last year. And Wal-Mart has committed they\\\\'re going to sell another 100 million light bulbs in the coming year. But it\\\\'s not easy. Consumers don\\\\'t really like these light bulbs. The light\\\\'s kind of funny, they won\\\\'t dim, takes a while for them to start up. But the pay-off is really enormous. 100 million compact fluorescent light bulbs means that we\\\\'ll save 600 million dollars in energy bills, and 20 million tons of CO2 every year, year in and year out. It does seem really hard to get consumers to do the right thing. It is stupid that we use two tons of steel, glass and plastic to haul our sorry selves to the shopping mall. It\\\\'s stupid that we put water in plastic bottles in Fiji and ship it here. (Laughter) It\\\\'s hard to change consumer behavior because consumers don\\\\'t know how much this stuff costs. Do you know? Do you know how much CO2 you generated to drive here or fly here? I don\\\\'t know, and I should. Those of us who care about all this would act better if we knew what the real costs were. But as long as we pretend that CO2 is free, as long as these uses are nearly invisible, how can we expect change? I\\\\'m really afraid, because I think the kinds of changes we can reasonably expect from individuals are going to be clearly not enough. The third lesson we learned is that policy matters. It really matters. In fact, policy is paramount. I\\\\'ve got a behind-the-scenes story for you about that green tech network I described. At the end of our first meeting, we got together to talk about what the action items would be, how we\\\\'d follow up. And Bob Epstein raised a hand. He stood up. You know, Bob\\\\'s that Berkeley techie type who started Sybase. Well, Bob said the most important thing we could do right now is to make it clear in Sacramento, California that we need a market-based system of mandates that\\\\'s going to cap and reduce greenhouse gases in California. It\\\\'s necessary and, just as important, it\\\\'s good for the California economy. So, eight of us went to Sacramento in August and we met with the seven undecided legislators and we lobbied for AB32. You know what? Six of those seven voted yes in favor of the bill, so it passed, and it passed by a vote of 47 to 32. (Applause) Please. Thank you. I think it\\\\'s the most important legislation of 2006. Why? Because California was the first state in this country to mandate 25 percent reduction of greenhouse gases by 2020. And the result of that is, we\\\\'re going to generate 83,000 new jobs, four billion dollars a year in annual income, and reduce the CO2 emissions by 174 million tons a year. California emits only seven percent of U.S. CO2 emissions. It\\\\'s only a percent and a half of the country\\\\'s CO2 emissions. It\\\\'s a great start, but I\\\\'ve got to tell you -- where I started -- I\\\\'m really afraid. In fact, I\\\\'m certain California\\\\'s not enough. Here\\\\'s a story about national policy that we could all learn from. You know Tom Friedman says, \\\\\\\"If you don\\\\'t go, you don\\\\'t know\\\\\\\"? Well, we went to Brazil to meet Dr. Jose Goldemberg. He\\\\'s the father of the ethanol revolution. He told us that Brazil\\\\'s government mandated that every gasoline station in the country would carry ethanol. And they mandated that their new vehicles would be flex-fuel compatible, right? They\\\\'d run ethanol or ordinary gasoline. And so, here\\\\'s what\\\\'s happened in Brazil. They now have 29,000 ethanol pumps -- this versus 700 in the U.S., and a paltry two in California -- and in three years their new car fleet has gone from four percent to 85 percent flex-fuel. Compare that to the U.S.: five percent are flex-fuel. And you know what? Most consumers who have them don\\\\'t even know it. So, what\\\\'s happened in Brazil is, they\\\\'ve replaced 40 percent of the gasoline consumed by their automotive fleet with ethanol. That\\\\'s 59 billion dollars since 1975 that they didn\\\\'t ship to the Middle East. It\\\\'s created a million jobs inside that country, and it\\\\'s saved 32 million tons of CO2. It\\\\'s really substantial. That\\\\'s 10 percent of the CO2 emissions across their entire country. But Brazil\\\\'s only 1.3 percent of the world\\\\'s CO2 emission. So, Brazil\\\\'s ethanol miracle, I\\\\'m really afraid, is not enough. In fact, I\\\\'m afraid all of the best policies we have are not going to be enough. The fourth and final lesson we\\\\'ve learned is about the potential of radical innovation. So, I want to tell you about a tragic problem and a breakthrough technology. Every year a million and a half people die of a completely preventable disease. That\\\\'s malaria. 6,000 people a day. All for want of two dollars\\\\' worth of medications that we can buy at the corner drugstore. Well, two dollars, two dollars is too much for Africa. So, a team of Berkeley researchers with 15 million dollars from the Gates Foundation is engineering, designing a radical new way to make the key ingredient, called artemisinin, and they\\\\'re going to make that drug 10 times cheaper. And in doing so, they\\\\'ll save a million lives -- at least a million lives a year. A million lives. Their breakthrough technology is synthetic biology. This leverages millions of years of evolution by redesigning bugs to make really useful products. Now, what you do is, you get inside the microbe, you change its metabolic pathways, and you end up with a living chemical factory. Now, you may ask, John, what has this got to go with green and with climate crisis? Well, I\\\\'ll tell you -- a lot. We\\\\'ve now formed a company called Amyris, and this technology that they\\\\'re using can be used to make better biofuels. Don\\\\'t let me skip over that. Better biofuels are a really big deal. That means we can precisely engineer the molecules in the fuel chain and optimize them along the way. So, if all goes well, they\\\\'re going to have designer bugs in warm vats that are eating and digesting sugars to excrete better biofuels. I guess that\\\\'s better living through bugs. Alan Kay is famous for saying the best way to predict the future is to invent it. And, of course, at Kleiner we, kind of, apologize and say the second best way is to finance it. And that\\\\'s why we\\\\'re investing 200 million dollars in a wide range of really disruptive new technologies for innovation in green technologies. And we\\\\'re encouraging others to do it as well. We\\\\'re talking a lot about this. In 2005, there were 600 million dollars invested in new technologies of the sort you see here. It doubled in 2006 to 1.2 billion dollars. But I\\\\'m really afraid we need much, much more. For reference, fact one: Exxon\\\\'s revenues in 2005 were a billion dollars a day. Do you know, they only invested 0.2 percent of revenues in R&D? Second fact: the President\\\\'s new budget for renewable energy is barely a billion dollars in total. Less than one day of Exxon\\\\'s revenues. Third fact: I bet you didn\\\\'t know that there\\\\'s enough energy in hot rocks under the country to supply America\\\\'s energy needs for the next thousand years. And the federal budget calls for a measly 20 million dollars of R&D in geothermal energy. It is almost criminal that we are not investing more in energy research in this country. And I am really afraid that it\\\\'s absolutely not enough. So, in a year\\\\'s worth of learning we found a bunch of surprises. Who would have thought that a mass retailer could make money by going green? Who would have thought that a database entrepreneur could transform California with legislation? Who would have thought that the ethanol biofuel miracle would come from a developing country in South America? And who would have thought that scientists trying to cure malaria could come up with breakthroughs in biofuels? And who would have thought that all that is not enough? Not enough to stabilize the climate. Not enough to keep the ice in Greenland from crashing into the ocean. The scientists tell us -- and they\\\\'re only guessing -- that we\\\\'ve got to reduce greenhouse gas emissions by one half, and do it as fast as possible. Now, we may have the political will to do this in the U.S., but I\\\\'ve got to tell you, we\\\\'ve got only one atmosphere, and so somehow we\\\\'re going to have to find the political will to do this all around the world. The wild card in this deck is China. To size the problem, China\\\\'s CO2 emissions today are 3.3 gigatons; the U.S. is 5.8. Business as usual means we\\\\'ll have 23 gigatons from China by 2050. That\\\\'s about as much CO2 as there is in the whole world. And if it\\\\'s business as usual, we\\\\'re going out of business. When I was in Davos, China\\\\'s Mayor of Dalian was pressed about their CO2 strategy, and he said the following, \\\\\\\"You know, Americans use seven times the CO2 per capita as Chinese.\\\\\\\" Then he asked, \\\\\\\"Why should China sacrifice our growth so that the West can continue to be profligate and stupid?\\\\\\\" Does anybody here have an answer for him? I don\\\\'t. We\\\\'ve got to make this economic so that all people and all nations make the right outcome, the profitable outcome, and therefore the likely outcome. Energy\\\\'s a six-trillion-dollar business worldwide. It is the mother of all markets. You remember that Internet? Well, I\\\\'ll tell you what. Green technologies -- going green -- is bigger than the Internet. It could be the biggest economic opportunity of the 21st century. Moreover, if we succeed, it\\\\'s going to be the most important transformation for life on the planet since, as Bill Joy says, we went from methane to oxygen in the atmosphere. Now, here\\\\'s the hard question, if the trajectory of all the world\\\\'s companies and individuals and policies and innovation is not going to be enough, what are we going to do? I don\\\\'t know. Everyone here cares about changing the world and has made a difference in that one way or another. So, our call to action -- my call to you -- is for you to make going green your next big thing, your gig. What can you do? You can personally get carbon neutral. Go to ClimateCrisis.org or CarbonCalculator.com and buy carbon credits. You could join other leaders in mandating, lobbying for mandated cap and trade in U.S. greenhouse gas reductions. There\\\\'s six bills right now in Congress. Let\\\\'s get one of them passed. And the most important thing you can do, I think, is to use your personal power and your Rolodex to lead your business, your institution, in going green. Do it like Wal-Mart, get it to go green for its customers and its suppliers and for itself. Really think outside the box. Can you imagine what it would be like if Amazon or eBay or Google or Microsoft or Apple really went green and you caused that to happen? It could be bigger than Wal-Mart. I can\\\\'t wait to see what we TEDsters do about this crisis. And I really, really hope that we multiply all of our energy, all of our talent and all of our influence to solve this problem. Because if we do, I can look forward to the conversation I\\\\'m going to have with my daughter in 20 years. (Applause)\",\"youTubeID\":\"nuXJFbJNltg\"}]",

And it\\\\'s truly a great honor\\\\nto have the opportunity to come to this stage twice;\\\\nI\\\\'m extremely grateful. I have been blown away by this conference, and I want to thank all of you\\\\nfor the many nice comments about what I had to say the other night. And I say that sincerely, partly because (Mock sob) I need that. (Laughter) Put yourselves in my position. (Laughter) I flew on Air Force Two for eight years. (Laughter) Now I have to take off my shoes\\\\nor boots to get on an airplane! (Laughter) (Applause) I\\\\'ll tell you one quick story to illustrate what\\\\nthat\\\\'s been like for me. (Laughter) It\\\\'s a true story --\\\\nevery bit of this is true. Soon after Tipper and I left the --\\\\n(Mock sob) White House -- (Laughter) we were driving from our home\\\\nin Nashville to a little farm we have 50 miles east of Nashville. Driving ourselves. (Laughter) I know it sounds like\\\\na little thing to you, but -- (Laughter) I looked in the rear-view mirror and all of a sudden it just hit me. There was no motorcade back there. (Laughter) You\\\\'ve heard of phantom limb pain? (Laughter) This was a rented Ford Taurus. (Laughter) It was dinnertime, and we started looking for a place to eat. We were on I-40. We got to Exit 238, Lebanon, Tennessee. We got off the exit,\\\\nwe found a Shoney\\\\'s restaurant. Low-cost family restaurant chain,\\\\nfor those of you who don\\\\'t know it. We went in and sat down at the booth,\\\\nand the waitress came over, made a big commotion over Tipper. (Laughter) She took our order, and then went\\\\nto the couple in the booth next to us, and she lowered her voice so much, I had to really strain to hear\\\\nwhat she was saying. And she said \\\\\\\"Yes, that\\\\'s former\\\\nVice President Al Gore and his wife, Tipper.\\\\\\\" And the man said, \\\\\\\"He\\\\'s come down a long way, hasn\\\\'t he?\\\\\\\" (Laughter) (Applause) There\\\\'s been kind\\\\nof a series of epiphanies. (Laughter) The very next day,\\\\ncontinuing the totally true story, I got on a G-V to fly to Africa\\\\nto make a speech in Nigeria, in the city of Lagos,\\\\non the topic of energy. And I began the speech\\\\nby telling them the story of what had just happened\\\\nthe day before in Nashville. And I told it pretty much the same way\\\\nI\\\\'ve just shared it with you: Tipper and I were driving ourselves, Shoney\\\\'s, low-cost\\\\nfamily restaurant chain, what the man said -- they laughed. I gave my speech, then went back\\\\nout to the airport to fly back home. I fell asleep on the plane until, during the middle\\\\nof the night, we landed on the Azores Islands for refueling. I woke up, they opened the door,\\\\nI went out to get some fresh air, and I looked, and there was a man\\\\nrunning across the runway. And he was waving a piece\\\\nof paper, and he was yelling, \\\\\\\"Call Washington! Call Washington!\\\\\\\" And I thought to myself,\\\\nin the middle of the night, in the middle of the Atlantic, what in the world could be\\\\nwrong in Washington? Then I remembered\\\\nit could be a bunch of things. (Laughter) But what it turned out to be, was that my staff was extremely upset because one of the wire services\\\\nin Nigeria had already written a story about my speech, and it had already been printed in cities all across the United States of America. It was printed in Monterey, I checked. (Laughter) And the story began, \\\\\\\"Former Vice President Al Gore\\\\nannounced in Nigeria yesterday,\\\\\\\" quote: \\\\'My wife Tipper and I have opened\\\\na low-cost family restaurant\\\\'\\\\\\\" -- (Laughter) \\\\\\\"\\\\'named Shoney\\\\'s, and we are running it ourselves.\\\\'\\\\\\\" (Laughter) Before I could get back to U.S. soil, David Letterman and Jay Leno\\\\nhad already started in on -- one of them had me\\\\nin a big white chef\\\\'s hat, Tipper was saying,\\\\n\\\\\\\"One more burger with fries!\\\\\\\" (Laughter) Three days later, I got a nice, long, handwritten letter from my friend and partner\\\\nand colleague Bill Clinton, saying, \\\\\\\"Congratulations\\\\non the new restaurant, Al!\\\\\\\" (Laughter) We like to celebrate\\\\neach other\\\\'s successes in life. (Laughter) I was going to talk\\\\nabout information ecology. But I was thinking that, since I plan to make a lifelong habit\\\\nof coming back to TED, that maybe I could talk\\\\nabout that another time. (Applause) Chris Anderson: It\\\\'s a deal! (Applause) Al Gore: I want to focus\\\\non what many of you have said you would like me to elaborate on: What can you do about the climate crisis? I want to start with a couple of -- I\\\\'m going to show some new images, and I\\\\'m going to recapitulate\\\\njust four or five. Now, the slide show. I update the slide show\\\\nevery time I give it. I add new images, because I learn more about it\\\\nevery time I give it. It\\\\'s like beach-combing, you know? Every time the tide comes in and out,\\\\nyou find some more shells. Just in the last two days, we got\\\\nthe new temperature records in January. This is just for\\\\nthe United States of America. Historical average\\\\nfor Januarys is 31 degrees; last month was 39.5 degrees. Now, I know that you wanted some more\\\\nbad news about the environment -- I\\\\'m kidding. But these are the recapitulation slides, and then I\\\\'m going to go into new\\\\nmaterial about what you can do. But I wanted to elaborate\\\\non a couple of these. First of all, this is where\\\\nwe\\\\'re projected to go with the U.S. contribution\\\\nto global warming, under business as usual. Efficiency in end-use electricity\\\\nand end-use of all energy is the low-hanging fruit. Efficiency and conservation --\\\\nit\\\\'s not a cost; it\\\\'s a profit. The sign is wrong. It\\\\'s not negative; it\\\\'s positive. These are investments\\\\nthat pay for themselves. But they are also very effective\\\\nin deflecting our path. Cars and trucks -- I talked\\\\nabout that in the slideshow, but I want you to put it in perspective. It\\\\'s an easy, visible target of concern -- and it should be -- but there is more global warming pollution\\\\nthat comes from buildings than from cars and trucks. Cars and trucks are very significant, and we have the lowest\\\\nstandards in the world. And so we should address that.\\\\nBut it\\\\'s part of the puzzle. Other transportation efficiency\\\\nis as important as cars and trucks. Renewables at the current levels\\\\nof technological efficiency can make this much difference. And with what Vinod, and John Doerr\\\\nand others, many of you here -- there are a lot of people\\\\ndirectly involved in this -- this wedge is going to grow\\\\nmuch more rapidly than the current projection shows it. Carbon Capture and Sequestration --\\\\nthat\\\\'s what CCS stands for -- is likely to become the killer app\\\\nthat will enable us to continue to use fossil fuels\\\\nin a way that is safe. Not quite there yet. OK. Now, what can you do? Reduce emissions in your home. Most of these expenditures\\\\nare also profitable. Insulation, better design. Buy green electricity where you can. I mentioned automobiles -- buy a hybrid. Use light rail. Figure out some of the other options\\\\nthat are much better. It\\\\'s important. Be a green consumer. You have choices with everything you buy, between things that have a harsh effect, or a much less harsh effect\\\\non the global climate crisis. Consider this: Make a decision to live\\\\na carbon-neutral life. Those of you who are good at branding, I\\\\'d love to get your advice and help on how to say this in a way\\\\nthat connects with the most people. It is easier than you think. It really is. A lot of us in here\\\\nhave made that decision, and it is really pretty easy. It means reduce\\\\nyour carbon dioxide emissions with the full range\\\\nof choices that you make, and then purchase or acquire offsets for the remainder that you have not\\\\ncompletely reduced. And what it means is elaborated\\\\nat climatecrisis.net. There is a carbon calculator. Participant Productions convened -- with my active involvement -- the leading software writers in the world, on this arcane science\\\\nof carbon calculation, to construct a consumer-friendly\\\\ncarbon calculator. You can very precisely calculate\\\\nwhat your CO2 emissions are, and then you will be given\\\\noptions to reduce. And by the time the movie\\\\ncomes out in May, this will be updated to 2.0, and we will have click-through\\\\npurchases of offsets. Next, consider making\\\\nyour business carbon-neutral. Again, some of us have done that, and it\\\\'s not as hard as you think. Integrate climate solutions\\\\ninto all of your innovations, whether you are from the technology, or entertainment, or design\\\\nand architecture community. Invest sustainably. Majora mentioned this. Listen, if you have invested money\\\\nwith managers who you compensate on the basis of their annual performance, don\\\\'t ever again complain\\\\nabout quarterly report CEO management. Over time, people do\\\\nwhat you pay them to do. And if they judge how much\\\\nthey\\\\'re going to get paid on your capital that they\\\\'ve invested, based on the short-term returns, you\\\\'re going to get short-term decisions. A lot more to be said about that. Become a catalyst of change. Teach others, learn about it,\\\\ntalk about it. The movie is a movie version\\\\nof the slideshow I gave two nights ago,\\\\nexcept it\\\\'s a lot more entertaining. And it comes out in May. Many of you here have the opportunity\\\\nto ensure that a lot of people see it. Consider sending somebody to Nashville. Pick well. And I am personally going to train people\\\\nto give this slideshow -- re-purposed, with some\\\\nof the personal stories obviously replaced with a generic approach, and it\\\\'s not just the slides,\\\\nit\\\\'s what they mean. And it\\\\'s how they link together. And so I\\\\'m going to be conducting\\\\na course this summer for a group of people that are\\\\nnominated by different folks to come and then give it en masse, in communities all across the country, and we\\\\'re going to update the slideshow\\\\nfor all of them every single week, to keep it right on the cutting edge. Working with Larry Lessig, it will be,\\\\nsomewhere in that process, posted with tools\\\\nand limited-use copyrights, so that young people can remix it\\\\nand do it in their own way. (Applause) Where did anybody get the idea that you ought to stay\\\\narm\\\\'s length from politics? It doesn\\\\'t mean\\\\nthat if you\\\\'re a Republican, that I\\\\'m trying to convince you\\\\nto be a Democrat. We need Republicans as well. This used to be a bipartisan issue, and I know that\\\\nin this group it really is. Become politically active. Make our democracy work the way\\\\nit\\\\'s supposed to work. Support the idea of capping\\\\ncarbon dioxide emissions -- global warming pollution --\\\\nand trading it. Here\\\\'s why: as long as the United States\\\\nis out of the world system, it\\\\'s not a closed system. Once it becomes a closed system,\\\\nwith U.S. participation, then everybody\\\\nwho\\\\'s on a board of directors -- how many people here\\\\nserve on the board of directors of a corporation? Once it\\\\'s a closed system, you will have legal liability\\\\nif you do not urge your CEO to get the maximum income from reducing\\\\nand trading the carbon emissions that can be avoided. The market will work\\\\nto solve this problem -- if we can accomplish this. Help with the mass persuasion campaign\\\\nthat will start this spring. We have to change the minds\\\\nof the American people. Because presently, the politicians\\\\ndo not have permission to do what needs to be done. And in our modern country, the role\\\\nof logic and reason no longer includes mediating between wealth and power\\\\nthe way it once did. It\\\\'s now repetition of short, hot-button,\\\\n30-second, 28-second television ads. We have to buy a lot of those ads. Let\\\\'s re-brand global warming,\\\\nas many of you have suggested. I like \\\\\\\"climate crisis\\\\\\\"\\\\ninstead of \\\\\\\"climate collapse,\\\\\\\" but again, those of you\\\\nwho are good at branding, I need your help on this. Somebody said the test\\\\nwe\\\\'re facing now, a scientist told me, is whether the combination\\\\nof an opposable thumb and a neocortex is a viable combination. (Laughter) That\\\\'s really true. I said the other night,\\\\nand I\\\\'ll repeat now: this is not a political issue. Again, the Republicans here --\\\\nthis shouldn\\\\'t be partisan. You have more influence\\\\nthan some of us who are Democrats do. This is an opportunity. Not just this, but connected\\\\nto the ideas that are here, to bring more coherence to them. We are one. Thank you very much, I appreciate it. (Applause)\",\"youTubeID\":\"rDiGYuQicpA\"}]",

And it\\\\'s truly a great honor\\\\nto have the opportunity to come to this stage twice;\\\\nI\\\\'m extremely grateful. I have been blown away by this conference, and I want to thank all of you\\\\nfor the many nice comments about what I had to say the other night. And I say that sincerely, partly because (Mock sob) I need that. (Laughter) Put yourselves in my position. (Laughter) I flew on Air Force Two for eight years. (Laughter) Now I have to take off my shoes\\\\nor boots to get on an airplane! (Laughter) (Applause) I\\\\'ll tell you one quick story to illustrate what\\\\nthat\\\\'s been like for me. (Laughter) It\\\\'s a true story --\\\\nevery bit of this is true. Soon after Tipper and I left the --\\\\n(Mock sob) White House -- (Laughter) we were driving from our home\\\\nin Nashville to a little farm we have 50 miles east of Nashville. Driving ourselves. (Laughter) I know it sounds like\\\\na little thing to you, but -- (Laughter) I looked in the rear-view mirror and all of a sudden it just hit me. There was no motorcade back there. (Laughter) You\\\\'ve heard of phantom limb pain? (Laughter) This was a rented Ford Taurus. (Laughter) It was dinnertime, and we started looking for a place to eat. We were on I-40. We got to Exit 238, Lebanon, Tennessee. We got off the exit,\\\\nwe found a Shoney\\\\'s restaurant. Low-cost family restaurant chain,\\\\nfor those of you who don\\\\'t know it. We went in and sat down at the booth,\\\\nand the waitress came over, made a big commotion over Tipper. (Laughter) She took our order, and then went\\\\nto the couple in the booth next to us, and she lowered her voice so much, I had to really strain to hear\\\\nwhat she was saying. And she said \\\\\\\"Yes, that\\\\'s former\\\\nVice President Al Gore and his wife, Tipper.\\\\\\\" And the man said, \\\\\\\"He\\\\'s come down a long way, hasn\\\\'t he?\\\\\\\" (Laughter) (Applause) There\\\\'s been kind\\\\nof a series of epiphanies. (Laughter) The very next day,\\\\ncontinuing the totally true story, I got on a G-V to fly to Africa\\\\nto make a speech in Nigeria, in the city of Lagos,\\\\non the topic of energy. And I began the speech\\\\nby telling them the story of what had just happened\\\\nthe day before in Nashville. And I told it pretty much the same way\\\\nI\\\\'ve just shared it with you: Tipper and I were driving ourselves, Shoney\\\\'s, low-cost\\\\nfamily restaurant chain, what the man said -- they laughed. I gave my speech, then went back\\\\nout to the airport to fly back home. I fell asleep on the plane until, during the middle\\\\nof the night, we landed on the Azores Islands for refueling. I woke up, they opened the door,\\\\nI went out to get some fresh air, and I looked, and there was a man\\\\nrunning across the runway. And he was waving a piece\\\\nof paper, and he was yelling, \\\\\\\"Call Washington! Call Washington!\\\\\\\" And I thought to myself,\\\\nin the middle of the night, in the middle of the Atlantic, what in the world could be\\\\nwrong in Washington? Then I remembered\\\\nit could be a bunch of things. (Laughter) But what it turned out to be, was that my staff was extremely upset because one of the wire services\\\\nin Nigeria had already written a story about my speech, and it had already been printed in cities all across the United States of America. It was printed in Monterey, I checked. (Laughter) And the story began, \\\\\\\"Former Vice President Al Gore\\\\nannounced in Nigeria yesterday,\\\\\\\" quote: \\\\'My wife Tipper and I have opened\\\\na low-cost family restaurant\\\\'\\\\\\\" -- (Laughter) \\\\\\\"\\\\'named Shoney\\\\'s, and we are running it ourselves.\\\\'\\\\\\\" (Laughter) Before I could get back to U.S. soil, David Letterman and Jay Leno\\\\nhad already started in on -- one of them had me\\\\nin a big white chef\\\\'s hat, Tipper was saying,\\\\n\\\\\\\"One more burger with fries!\\\\\\\" (Laughter) Three days later, I got a nice, long, handwritten letter from my friend and partner\\\\nand colleague Bill Clinton, saying, \\\\\\\"Congratulations\\\\non the new restaurant, Al!\\\\\\\" (Laughter) We like to celebrate\\\\neach other\\\\'s successes in life. (Laughter) I was going to talk\\\\nabout information ecology. But I was thinking that, since I plan to make a lifelong habit\\\\nof coming back to TED, that maybe I could talk\\\\nabout that another time. (Applause) Chris Anderson: It\\\\'s a deal! (Applause) Al Gore: I want to focus\\\\non what many of you have said you would like me to elaborate on: What can you do about the climate crisis? I want to start with a couple of -- I\\\\'m going to show some new images, and I\\\\'m going to recapitulate\\\\njust four or five. Now, the slide show. I update the slide show\\\\nevery time I give it. I add new images, because I learn more about it\\\\nevery time I give it. It\\\\'s like beach-combing, you know? Every time the tide comes in and out,\\\\nyou find some more shells. Just in the last two days, we got\\\\nthe new temperature records in January. This is just for\\\\nthe United States of America. Historical average\\\\nfor Januarys is 31 degrees; last month was 39.5 degrees. Now, I know that you wanted some more\\\\nbad news about the environment -- I\\\\'m kidding. But these are the recapitulation slides, and then I\\\\'m going to go into new\\\\nmaterial about what you can do. But I wanted to elaborate\\\\non a couple of these. First of all, this is where\\\\nwe\\\\'re projected to go with the U.S. contribution\\\\nto global warming, under business as usual. Efficiency in end-use electricity\\\\nand end-use of all energy is the low-hanging fruit. Efficiency and conservation --\\\\nit\\\\'s not a cost; it\\\\'s a profit. The sign is wrong. It\\\\'s not negative; it\\\\'s positive. These are investments\\\\nthat pay for themselves. But they are also very effective\\\\nin deflecting our path. Cars and trucks -- I talked\\\\nabout that in the slideshow, but I want you to put it in perspective. It\\\\'s an easy, visible target of concern -- and it should be -- but there is more global warming pollution\\\\nthat comes from buildings than from cars and trucks. Cars and trucks are very significant, and we have the lowest\\\\nstandards in the world. And so we should address that.\\\\nBut it\\\\'s part of the puzzle. Other transportation efficiency\\\\nis as important as cars and trucks. Renewables at the current levels\\\\nof technological efficiency can make this much difference. And with what Vinod, and John Doerr\\\\nand others, many of you here -- there are a lot of people\\\\ndirectly involved in this -- this wedge is going to grow\\\\nmuch more rapidly than the current projection shows it. Carbon Capture and Sequestration --\\\\nthat\\\\'s what CCS stands for -- is likely to become the killer app\\\\nthat will enable us to continue to use fossil fuels\\\\nin a way that is safe. Not quite there yet. OK. Now, what can you do? Reduce emissions in your home. Most of these expenditures\\\\nare also profitable. Insulation, better design. Buy green electricity where you can. I mentioned automobiles -- buy a hybrid. Use light rail. Figure out some of the other options\\\\nthat are much better. It\\\\'s important. Be a green consumer. You have choices with everything you buy, between things that have a harsh effect, or a much less harsh effect\\\\non the global climate crisis. Consider this: Make a decision to live\\\\na carbon-neutral life. Those of you who are good at branding, I\\\\'d love to get your advice and help on how to say this in a way\\\\nthat connects with the most people. It is easier than you think. It really is. A lot of us in here\\\\nhave made that decision, and it is really pretty easy. It means reduce\\\\nyour carbon dioxide emissions with the full range\\\\nof choices that you make, and then purchase or acquire offsets for the remainder that you have not\\\\ncompletely reduced. And what it means is elaborated\\\\nat climatecrisis.net. There is a carbon calculator. Participant Productions convened -- with my active involvement -- the leading software writers in the world, on this arcane science\\\\nof carbon calculation, to construct a consumer-friendly\\\\ncarbon calculator. You can very precisely calculate\\\\nwhat your CO2 emissions are, and then you will be given\\\\noptions to reduce. And by the time the movie\\\\ncomes out in May, this will be updated to 2.0, and we will have click-through\\\\npurchases of offsets. Next, consider making\\\\nyour business carbon-neutral. Again, some of us have done that, and it\\\\'s not as hard as you think. Integrate climate solutions\\\\ninto all of your innovations, whether you are from the technology, or entertainment, or design\\\\nand architecture community. Invest sustainably. Majora mentioned this. Listen, if you have invested money\\\\nwith managers who you compensate on the basis of their annual performance, don\\\\'t ever again complain\\\\nabout quarterly report CEO management. Over time, people do\\\\nwhat you pay them to do. And if they judge how much\\\\nthey\\\\'re going to get paid on your capital that they\\\\'ve invested, based on the short-term returns, you\\\\'re going to get short-term decisions. A lot more to be said about that. Become a catalyst of change. Teach others, learn about it,\\\\ntalk about it. The movie is a movie version\\\\nof the slideshow I gave two nights ago,\\\\nexcept it\\\\'s a lot more entertaining. And it comes out in May. Many of you here have the opportunity\\\\nto ensure that a lot of people see it. Consider sending somebody to Nashville. Pick well. And I am personally going to train people\\\\nto give this slideshow -- re-purposed, with some\\\\nof the personal stories obviously replaced with a generic approach, and it\\\\'s not just the slides,\\\\nit\\\\'s what they mean. And it\\\\'s how they link together. And so I\\\\'m going to be conducting\\\\na course this summer for a group of people that are\\\\nnominated by different folks to come and then give it en masse, in communities all across the country, and we\\\\'re going to update the slideshow\\\\nfor all of them every single week, to keep it right on the cutting edge. Working with Larry Lessig, it will be,\\\\nsomewhere in that process, posted with tools\\\\nand limited-use copyrights, so that young people can remix it\\\\nand do it in their own way. (Applause) Where did anybody get the idea that you ought to stay\\\\narm\\\\'s length from politics? It doesn\\\\'t mean\\\\nthat if you\\\\'re a Republican, that I\\\\'m trying to convince you\\\\nto be a Democrat. We need Republicans as well. This used to be a bipartisan issue, and I know that\\\\nin this group it really is. Become politically active. Make our democracy work the way\\\\nit\\\\'s supposed to work. Support the idea of capping\\\\ncarbon dioxide emissions -- global warming pollution --\\\\nand trading it. Here\\\\'s why: as long as the United States\\\\nis out of the world system, it\\\\'s not a closed system. Once it becomes a closed system,\\\\nwith U.S. participation, then everybody\\\\nwho\\\\'s on a board of directors -- how many people here\\\\nserve on the board of directors of a corporation? Once it\\\\'s a closed system, you will have legal liability\\\\nif you do not urge your CEO to get the maximum income from reducing\\\\nand trading the carbon emissions that can be avoided. The market will work\\\\nto solve this problem -- if we can accomplish this. Help with the mass persuasion campaign\\\\nthat will start this spring. We have to change the minds\\\\nof the American people. Because presently, the politicians\\\\ndo not have permission to do what needs to be done. And in our modern country, the role\\\\nof logic and reason no longer includes mediating between wealth and power\\\\nthe way it once did. It\\\\'s now repetition of short, hot-button,\\\\n30-second, 28-second television ads. We have to buy a lot of those ads. Let\\\\'s re-brand global warming,\\\\nas many of you have suggested. I like \\\\\\\"climate crisis\\\\\\\"\\\\ninstead of \\\\\\\"climate collapse,\\\\\\\" but again, those of you\\\\nwho are good at branding, I need your help on this. Somebody said the test\\\\nwe\\\\'re facing now, a scientist told me, is whether the combination\\\\nof an opposable thumb and a neocortex is a viable combination. (Laughter) That\\\\'s really true. I said the other night,\\\\nand I\\\\'ll repeat now: this is not a political issue. Again, the Republicans here --\\\\nthis shouldn\\\\'t be partisan. You have more influence\\\\nthan some of us who are Democrats do. This is an opportunity. Not just this, but connected\\\\nto the ideas that are here, to bring more coherence to them. We are one. Thank you very much, I appreciate it. (Applause)\",\"youTubeID\":\"rDiGYuQicpA\"}]",

          "body": "[{\"name\":\"Jane Goodall: What separates us from chimpanzees?\",\"transcript\":\"Good morning everyone. First of all, it\\\\'s been fantastic being here over these past few days. And secondly, I feel it\\\\'s a great honor to kind of wind up this extraordinary gathering of people, these amazing talks that we\\\\'ve had. I feel that I\\\\'ve fitted in, in many ways, to some of the things that I\\\\'ve heard. I came directly here from the deep, deep tropical rainforest in Ecuador, where I was out -- you could only get there by a plane -- with indigenous people with paint on their faces and parrot feathers on their headdresses, where these people are fighting to try and keep the oil companies, and keep the roads, out of their forests. They\\\\'re fighting to develop their own way of living within the forest in a world that\\\\'s clean, a world that isn\\\\'t contaminated, a world that isn\\\\'t polluted. And what was so amazing to me, and what fits right in with what we\\\\'re all talking about here at TED, is that there, right in the middle of this rainforest, was some solar panels -- the first in that part of Ecuador -- and that was mainly to bring water up by pump so that the women wouldn\\\\'t have to go down. The water was cleaned, but because they got a lot of batteries, they were able to store a lot of electricity. So every house -- and there were, I think, eight houses in this little community -- could have light for, I think it was about half an hour each evening. And there is the Chief, in all his regal finery, with a laptop computer. (Laughter) And this man, he has been outside, but he\\\\'s gone back, and he was saying, \\\\\\\"You know, we have suddenly jumped into a whole new era, and we didn\\\\'t even know about the white man 50 years ago, and now here we are with laptop computers, and there are some things we want to learn from the modern world. We want to know about health care. We want to know about what other people do -- we\\\\'re interested in it. And we want to learn other languages. We want to know English and French and perhaps Chinese, and we\\\\'re good at languages.\\\\\\\" So there he is with his little laptop computer, but fighting against the might of the pressures -- because of the debt, the foreign debt of Ecuador -- fighting the pressure of World Bank, IMF, and of course the people who want to exploit the forests and take out the oil. And so, coming directly from there to here. But, of course, my real field of expertise lies in an even different kind of civilization -- I can\\\\'t really call it a civilization. A different way of life, a different being. We\\\\'ve talked earlier -- this wonderful talk by Wade Davis about the different cultures of the humans around the world -- but the world is not composed only of human beings; there are also other animal beings. And I propose to bring into this TED conference, as I always do around the world, the voice of the animal kingdom. Too often we just see a few slides, or a bit of film, but these beings have voices that mean something. And so, I want to give you a greeting, as from a chimpanzee in the forests of Tanzania -- Ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh! (Applause) I\\\\'ve been studying chimpanzees in Tanzania since 1960. During that time, there have been modern technologies that have really transformed the way that field biologists do their work. For example, for the first time, a few years ago, by simply collecting little fecal samples we were able to have them analyzed -- to have DNA profiling done -- so for the first time, we actually know which male chimps are the fathers of each individual infant. Because the chimps have a very promiscuous mating society. So this opens up a whole new avenue of research. And we use GSI -- geographic whatever it is, GSI -- to determine the range of the chimps. And we\\\\'re using -- you can see that I\\\\'m not really into this kind of stuff -- but we\\\\'re using satellite imagery to look at the deforestation in the area. And of course, there\\\\'s developments in infrared, so you can watch animals at night, and equipment for recording by video, and tape recording is getting lighter and better. So in many, many ways, we can do things today that we couldn\\\\'t do when I began in 1960. Especially when chimpanzees, and other animals with large brains, are studied in captivity, modern technology is helping us to search for the upper levels of cognition in some of these non-human animals. So that we know today, they\\\\'re capable of performances that would have been thought absolutely impossible by science when I began. I think the chimpanzee in captivity who is the most skilled in intellectual performance is one called Ai in Japan -- her name means love -- and she has a wonderfully sensitive partner working with her. She loves her computer -- she\\\\'ll leave her big group, and her running water, and her trees and everything. And she\\\\'ll come in to sit at this computer -- it\\\\'s like a video game for a kid; she\\\\'s hooked. She\\\\'s 28, by the way, and she does things with her computer screen and a touch pad that she can do faster than most humans. She does very complex tasks, and I haven\\\\'t got time to go into them, but the amazing thing about this female is she doesn\\\\'t like making mistakes. If she has a bad run, and her score isn\\\\'t good, she\\\\'ll come and reach up and tap on the glass -- because she can\\\\'t see the experimenter -- which is asking to have another go. And her concentration -- she\\\\'s already concentrated hard for 20 minutes or so, and now she wants to do it all over again, just for the satisfaction of having done it better. And the food is not important -- she does get a tiny reward, like one raisin for a correct response -- but she will do it for nothing, if you tell her beforehand. So here we are, a chimpanzee using a computer. Chimpanzees, gorillas, orangutans also learn human sign language. But the point is that when I was first in Gombe in 1960 -- I remember so well, so vividly, as though it was yesterday -- the first time, when I was going through the vegetation, the chimpanzees were still running away from me, for the most part, although some were a little bit acclimatized -- and I saw this dark shape, hunched over a termite mound, and I peered with my binoculars. It was, fortunately, one adult male whom I\\\\'d named David Greybeard -- and by the way, science at that time was telling me that I shouldn\\\\'t name the chimps; they should all have numbers; that was more scientific. Anyway, David Greybeard -- and I saw that he was picking little pieces of grass and using them to fish termites from their underground nest. And not only that -- he would sometimes pick a leafy twig and strip the leaves -- modifying an object to make it suitable for a specific purpose -- the beginning of tool-making. The reason this was so exciting and such a breakthrough is at that time, it was thought that humans, and only humans, used and made tools. When I was at school, we were defined as man, the toolmaker. So that when Louis Leakey, my mentor, heard this news, he said, \\\\\\\"Ah, we must now redefine \\\\'man,\\\\' redefine \\\\'tool,\\\\' or accept chimpanzees as humans.\\\\\\\" (Laughter) We now know that at Gombe alone, there are nine different ways in which chimpanzees use different objects for different purposes. Moreover, we know that in different parts of Africa, wherever chimps have been studied, there are completely different tool-using behaviors. And because it seems that these patterns are passed from one generation to the next, through observation, imitation and practice -- that is a definition of human culture. What we find is that over these 40-odd years that I and others have been studying chimpanzees and the other great apes, and, as I say, other mammals with complex brains and social systems, we have found that after all, there isn\\\\'t a sharp line dividing humans from the rest of the animal kingdom. It\\\\'s a very wuzzy line. It\\\\'s getting wuzzier all the time as we find animals doing things that we, in our arrogance, used to think was just human. The chimps -- there\\\\'s no time to discuss their fascinating lives -- but they have this long childhood, five years of suckling and sleeping with the mother, and then another three, four or five years of emotional dependence on her, even when the next child is born. The importance of learning in that time, when behavior is flexible -- and there\\\\'s an awful lot to learn in chimpanzee society. The long-term affectionate supportive bonds that develop throughout this long childhood with the mother, with the brothers and sisters, and which can last through a lifetime, which may be up to 60 years. They can actually live longer than 60 in captivity, so we\\\\'ve only done 40 years in the wild so far. And we find chimps are capable of true compassion and altruism. We find in their non-verbal communication -- this is very rich -- they have a lot of sounds, which they use in different circumstances, but they also use touch, posture, gesture, and what do they do? They kiss; they embrace; they hold hands. They pat one another on the back; they swagger; they shake their fist -- the kind of things that we do, and they do them in the same kind of context. They have very sophisticated cooperation. Sometimes they hunt -- not that often, but when they hunt, they show sophisticated cooperation, and they share the prey. We find that they show emotions, similar to -- maybe sometimes the same -- as those that we describe in ourselves as happiness, sadness, fear, despair. They know mental as well as physical suffering. And I don\\\\'t have time to go into the information that will prove some of these things to you, save to say that there are very bright students, in the best universities, studying emotions in animals, studying personalities in animals. We know that chimpanzees and some other creatures can recognize themselves in mirrors -- \\\\\\\"self\\\\\\\" as opposed to \\\\\\\"other.\\\\\\\" They have a sense of humor, and these are the kind of things which traditionally have been thought of as human prerogatives. But this teaches us a new respect -- and it\\\\'s a new respect not only for the chimpanzees, I suggest, but some of the other amazing animals with whom we share this planet. Once we\\\\'re prepared to admit that after all, we\\\\'re not the only beings with personalities, minds and above all feelings, and then we start to think about ways we use and abuse so many other sentient, sapient creatures on this planet, it really gives cause for deep shame, at least for me. So, the sad thing is that these chimpanzees -- who\\\\'ve perhaps taught us, more than any other creature, a little humility -- are in the wild, disappearing very fast. They\\\\'re disappearing for the reasons that all of you in this room know only too well. The deforestation, the growth of human populations, needing more land. They\\\\'re disappearing because some timber companies go in with clear-cutting. They\\\\'re disappearing in the heart of their range in Africa because the big multinational logging companies have come in and made roads -- as they want to do in Ecuador and other parts where the forests remain untouched -- to take out oil or timber. And this has led in Congo basin, and other parts of the world, to what is known as the bush-meat trade. This means that although for hundreds, perhaps thousands of years, people have lived in those forests, or whatever habitat it is, in harmony with their world, just killing the animals they need for themselves and their families -- now, suddenly, because of the roads, the hunters can go in from the towns. They shoot everything, every single thing that moves that\\\\'s bigger than a small rat; they sun-dry it or smoke it. And now they\\\\'ve got transport; they take it on the logging trucks or the mining trucks into the towns where they sell it. And people will pay more for bush-meat, as it\\\\'s called, than for domestic meat -- it\\\\'s culturally preferred. And it\\\\'s not sustainable, and the huge logging camps in the forest are now demanding meat, so the Pygmy hunters in the Congo basin who\\\\'ve lived there with their wonderful way of living for so many hundreds of years are now corrupted. They\\\\'re given weapons; they shoot for the logging camps; they get money. Their culture is being destroyed, along with the animals upon whom they depend. So, when the logging camp moves, there\\\\'s nothing left. We talked already about the loss of human cultural diversity, and I\\\\'ve seen it happening with my own eyes. And the grim picture in Africa -- I love Africa, and what do we see in Africa? We see deforestation; we see the desert spreading; we see massive hunger; we see disease and we see population growth in areas where there are more people living on a certain piece of land than the land can possibly support, and they\\\\'re too poor to buy food from elsewhere. Were the people that we heard about yesterday, on the Easter Island, who cut down their last tree -- were they stupid? Didn\\\\'t they know what was happening? Of course, but if you\\\\'ve seen the crippling poverty in some of these parts of the world it isn\\\\'t a question of \\\\\\\"Let\\\\'s leave the tree for tomorrow.\\\\\\\" \\\\\\\"How am I going to feed my family today? Maybe I can get just a few dollars from this last tree which will keep us going a little bit longer, and then we\\\\'ll pray that something will happen to save us from the inevitable end.\\\\\\\" So, this is a pretty grim picture. The one thing we have, which makes us so different from chimpanzees or other living creatures, is this sophisticated spoken language -- a language with which we can tell children about things that aren\\\\'t here. We can talk about the distant past, plan for the distant future, discuss ideas with each other, so that the ideas can grow from the accumulated wisdom of a group. We can do it by talking to each other; we can do it through video; we can do it through the written word. And we are abusing this great power we have to be wise stewards, and we\\\\'re destroying the world. In the developed world, in a way, it\\\\'s worse, because we have so much access to knowledge of the stupidity of what we\\\\'re doing. Do you know, we\\\\'re bringing little babies into a world where, in many places, the water is poisoning them? And the air is harming them, and the food that\\\\'s grown from the contaminated land is poisoning them. And that\\\\'s not just in the far-away developing world; that\\\\'s everywhere. Do you know we all have about 50 chemicals in our bodies we didn\\\\'t have about 50 years ago? And so many of these diseases, like asthma and certain kinds of cancers, are on the increase around places where our filthy toxic waste is dumped. We\\\\'re harming ourselves around the world, as well as harming the animals, as well as harming nature herself -- Mother Nature, that brought us into being; Mother Nature, where I believe we need to spend time, where there\\\\'s trees and flowers and birds for our good psychological development. And yet, there are hundreds and hundreds of children in the developed world who never see nature, because they\\\\'re growing up in concrete and all they know is virtual reality, with no opportunity to go and lie in the sun, or in the forest, with the dappled sun-specks coming down from the canopy above. As I was traveling around the world, you know, I had to leave the forest -- that\\\\'s where I love to be. I had to leave these fascinating chimpanzees for my students and field staff to continue studying because, finding they dwindled from about two million 100 years ago to about 150,000 now, I knew I had to leave the forest to do what I could to raise awareness around the world. And the more I talked about the chimpanzees\\\\' plight, the more I realized the fact that everything\\\\'s interconnected, and the problems of the developing world so often stem from the greed of the developed world, and everything was joining together, and making -- not sense, hope lies in sense, you said -- it\\\\'s making a nonsense. How can we do it? Somebody said that yesterday. And as I was traveling around, I kept meeting young people who\\\\'d lost hope. They were feeling despair, they were feeling, \\\\\\\"Well, it doesn\\\\'t matter what we do; eat, drink and be merry, for tomorrow we die. Everything is hopeless -- we\\\\'re always being told so by the media.\\\\\\\" And then I met some who were angry, and anger that can turn to violence, and we\\\\'re all familiar with that. And I have three little grandchildren, and when some of these students would say to me at high school or university, they\\\\'d say, \\\\\\\"We\\\\'re angry,\\\\\\\" or \\\\\\\"We\\\\'re filled with despair, because we feel you\\\\'ve compromised our future, and there\\\\'s nothing we can do about it.\\\\\\\" And I looked in the eyes of my little grandchildren, and think how much we\\\\'ve harmed this planet since I was their age. I feel this deep shame, and that\\\\'s why in 1991 in Tanzania, I started a program that\\\\'s called Roots and Shoots. There\\\\'s little brochures all around outside, and if any of you have anything to do with children and care about their future, I beg that you pick up that brochure. And Roots and Shoots is a program for hope. Roots make a firm foundation. Shoots seem tiny, but to reach the sun they can break through brick walls. See the brick walls as all the problems that we\\\\'ve inflicted on this planet. Then, you see, it is a message of hope. Hundreds and thousands of young people around the world can break through, and can make this a better world. And the most important message of Roots and Shoots is that every single individual makes a difference. Every individual has a role to play. Every one of us impacts the world around us everyday, and you scientists know that you can\\\\'t actually -- even if you stay in bed all day, you\\\\'re breathing oxygen and giving out CO2, and probably going to the loo, and things like that -- you\\\\'re making a difference in the world. So, the Roots and Shoots program involves youth in three kinds of projects. And these are projects to make the world around them a better place. One project to show care and concern for your own human community. One for animals, including domestic animals -- and I have to say, I learned everything I know about animal behavior even before I got to Gombe and the chimps from my dog, Rusty, who was my childhood companion. And the third kind of project: something for the local environment. So what the kids do depends first of all, how old are they -- and we go now from pre-school right through university. It\\\\'s going to depend whether they\\\\'re inner-city or rural. It\\\\'s going to depend if they\\\\'re wealthy or impoverished. It\\\\'s going to depend which part, say, of America they\\\\'re in. We\\\\'re in every state now, and the problems in Florida are different from the problems in New York. It\\\\'s going to depend on which country they\\\\'re in -- and we\\\\'re already in 60-plus countries, with about 5,000 active groups -- and there are groups all over the place that I keep hearing about that I\\\\'ve never even heard of, because the kids are taking the program and spreading it themselves. Why? Because they\\\\'re buying into it, and they\\\\'re the ones who get to decide what they\\\\'re going to do. It isn\\\\'t something that their parents tell them, or their teachers tell them. That\\\\'s effective, but if they decide themselves, \\\\\\\"We want to clean this river and put the fish back that used to be there. We want to clear away the toxic soil from this area and have an organic garden. We want to go and spend time with the old people and hear their stories and record their oral histories. We want to go and work in a dog shelter. We want to learn about animals. We want ... \\\\\\\" You know, it goes on and on, and this is very hopeful for me. As I travel around the world 300 days a year, everywhere there\\\\'s a group of Roots and Shoots of different ages. Everywhere there are children with shining eyes saying, \\\\\\\"Look at the difference we\\\\'ve made.\\\\\\\" And now comes the technology into it, because with this new way of communicating electronically these kids can communicate with each other around the world. And if anyone is interested to help us, we\\\\'ve got so many ideas but we need help -- we need help to create the right kind of system that will help these young people to communicate their excitement. But also -- and this is so important -- to communicate their despair, to say, \\\\\\\"We\\\\'ve tried this and it doesn\\\\'t work, and what shall we do?\\\\\\\" And then, lo and behold, there\\\\'s another group answering these kids who may be in America, or maybe this is a group in Israel, saying, \\\\\\\"Yeah, you did it a little bit wrong. This is how you should do it.\\\\\\\" The philosophy is very simple. We do not believe in violence. No violence, no bombs, no guns. That\\\\'s not the way to solve problems. Violence leads to violence, at least in my view. So how do we solve? The tools for solving the problems are knowledge and understanding. Know the facts, but see how they fit in the big picture. Hard work and persistence --don\\\\'t give up -- and love and compassion leading to respect for all life. How many more minutes? Two, one? Chris Anderson: One -- one to two. Jane Goodall: Two, two, I\\\\'m going to take two. (Laughter) Are you going to come and drag me off? (Laughter) Anyway -- so basically, Roots and Shoots is beginning to change young people\\\\'s lives. It\\\\'s what I\\\\'m devoting most of my energy to. And I believe that a group like this can have a very major impact, not just because you can share technology with us, but because so many of you have children. And if you take this program out, and give it to your children, they have such a good opportunity to go out and do good, because they\\\\'ve got parents like you. And it\\\\'s been so clear how much you all care about trying to make this world a better place. It\\\\'s very encouraging. But the kids do ask me -- and this won\\\\'t take more than two minutes, I promise -- the kids say, \\\\\\\"Dr. Jane, do you really have hope for the future? You travel, you see all these horrible things happening.\\\\\\\" Firstly, the human brain -- I don\\\\'t need to say anything about that. Now that we know what the problems are around the world, human brains like yours are rising to solve those problems. And we\\\\'ve talked a lot about that. Secondly, the resilience of nature. We can destroy a river, and we can bring it back to life. We can see a whole area desolated, and it can be brought back to bloom again, with time or a little help. And thirdly, the last speaker talked about -- or the speaker before last, talked about the indomitable human spirit. We are surrounded by the most amazing people who do things that seem to be absolutely impossible. Nelson Mandela -- I take a little piece of limestone from Robben Island Prison, where he labored for 27 years, and came out with so little bitterness, he could lead his people from the horror of apartheid without a bloodbath. Even after the 11th of September -- and I was in New York and I felt the fear -- nevertheless, there was so much human courage, so much love and so much compassion. And then as I went around the country after that and felt the fear -- the fear that was leading to people feeling they couldn\\\\'t worry about the environment any more, in case they seemed not to be patriotic -- and I was trying to encourage them, somebody came up with a little quotation from Mahatma Gandhi, \\\\\\\"If you look back through human history, you see that every evil regime has been overcome by good.\\\\\\\" And just after that a woman brought me this little bell, and I want to end on this note. She said, \\\\\\\"If you\\\\'re talking about hope and peace, ring this. This bell is made from metal from a defused landmine, from the killing fields of Pol Pot -- one of the most evil regimes in human history -- where people are now beginning to put their lives back together after the regime has crumbled. So, yes, there is hope, and where is the hope? Is it out there with the politicians? It\\\\'s in our hands. It\\\\'s in your hands and my hands and those of our children. It\\\\'s really up to us. We\\\\'re the ones who can make a difference. If we lead lives where we consciously leave the lightest possible ecological footprints, if we buy the things that are ethical for us to buy and don\\\\'t buy the things that are not, we can change the world overnight. Thank you.\",\"youTubeID\":\"51z7WRDjOjM\"},{\"name\":\"Roger Ebert: Remaking my voice\",\"transcript\":\"Roger Ebert: These are my words, but this is not my voice. This is Alex, the best computer voice I\\\\'ve been able to find, which comes as standard equipment on every Macintosh. For most of my life, I never gave a second thought to my ability to speak. It was like breathing. In those days, I was living in a fool\\\\'s paradise. After surgeries for cancer took away my ability to speak, eat or drink, I was forced to enter this virtual world in which a computer does some of my living for me. For several days now, we have enjoyed brilliant and articulate speakers here at TED. I used to be able to talk like that. Maybe I wasn\\\\'t as smart, but I was at least as talkative. I want to devote my talk today to the act of speaking itself, and how the act of speaking or not speaking is tied so indelibly to one\\\\'s identity as to force the birth of a new person when it is taken away. However, I\\\\'ve found that listening to a computer voice for any great length of time can be monotonous. So I\\\\'ve decided to recruit some of my TED friends to read my words aloud for me. I will start with my wife, Chaz. Chaz Ebert: It was Chaz who stood by my side through three attempts to reconstruct my jaw and restore my ability to speak. Going into the first surgery for a recurrence of salivary cancer in 2006, I expected to be out of the hospital in time to return to my movie review show, \\\\'Ebert and Roeper at the Movies.\\\\' I had pre-taped enough shows to get me through six weeks of surgery and recuperation. The doctors took a fibula bone from my leg and some tissue from my shoulder to fashion into a new jaw. My tongue, larynx and vocal cords were still healthy and unaffected. (Laughter) (Laughter) CE: I was optimistic, and all was right with the world. The first surgery was a great success. I saw myself in the mirror and I looked pretty good. Two weeks later, I was ready to return home. I was using my iPod to play the Leonard Cohen song \\\\'I\\\\'m Your Man\\\\' for my doctors and nurses. Suddenly, I had an episode of catastrophic bleeding. My carotid artery had ruptured. Thank God I was still in my hospital room and my doctors were right there. Chaz told me that if that song hadn\\\\'t played for so long, I might have already been in the car, on the way home, and would have died right there and then. So thank you, Leonard Cohen, for saving my life. (Applause) There was a second surgery -- which held up for five or six days and then it also fell apart. And then a third attempt, which also patched me back together pretty well, until it failed. A doctor from Brazil said he had never seen anyone survive a carotid artery rupture. And before I left the hospital, after a year of being hospitalized, I had seven ruptures of my carotid artery. There was no particular day when anyone told me I would never speak again; it just sort of became obvious. Human speech is an ingenious manipulation of our breath within the sound chamber of our mouth and respiratory system. We need to be able to hold and manipulate that breath in order to form sounds. Therefore, the system must be essentially airtight in order to capture air. Because I had lost my jaw, I could no longer form a seal, and therefore my tongue and all of my other vocal equipment was rendered powerless. Dean Ornish: At first for a long time, I wrote messages in notebooks. Then I tried typing words on my laptop and using its built in voice. This was faster, and nobody had to try to read my handwriting. I tried out various computer voices that were available online, and for several months I had a British accent, which Chaz called Sir Lawrence.\\\\\\\" (Laughter) \\\\\\\"It was the clearest I could find. Then Apple released the Alex voice, which was the best I\\\\'d heard. It knew things like the difference between an exclamation point and a question mark. When it saw a period, it knew how to make a sentence sound like it was ending instead of staying up in the air. There are all sorts of html codes you can use to control the timing and inflection of computer voices, and I\\\\'ve experimented with them. For me, they share a fundamental problem: they\\\\'re too slow. When I find myself in a conversational situation, I need to type fast and to jump right in. People don\\\\'t have the time or the patience to wait for me to fool around with the codes for every word or phrase. But what value do we place on the sound of our own voice? How does that affect who you are as a person? When people hear Alex speaking my words, do they experience a disconnect? Does that create a separation or a distance from one person to the next? How did I feel not being able to speak? I felt, and I still feel, a lot of distance from the human mainstream. I\\\\'ve become uncomfortable when I\\\\'m separated from my laptop. Even then, I\\\\'m aware that most people have little patience for my speaking difficulties. So Chaz suggested finding a company that could make a customized voice using my TV show voice from a period of 30 years. At first I was against it. I thought it would be creepy to hear my own voice coming from a computer. There was something comforting about a voice that was not my own. But I decided then to just give it a try. So we contacted a company in Scotland that created personalized computer voices. They\\\\'d never made one from previously-recorded materials. All of their voices had been made by a speaker recording original words in a control booth. But they were willing to give it a try. So I sent them many hours of recordings of my voice, including several audio commentary tracks that I\\\\'d made for movies on DVDs. And it sounded like me, it really did. There was a reason for that; it was me. But it wasn\\\\'t that simple. The tapes from my TV show weren\\\\'t very useful because there were too many other kinds of audio involved -- movie soundtracks, for example, or Gene Siskel arguing with me -- (Laughter) and my words often had a particular emphasis that didn\\\\'t fit into a sentence well enough. I\\\\'ll let you hear a sample of that voice. These are a few of the comments I recorded for use when Chaz and I appeared on the Oprah Winfrey program. And here\\\\'s the voice we call Roger Jr. or Roger 2.0. Roger 2.0: Oprah, I can\\\\'t tell you how great it is to be back on your show. We have been talking for a long time, and now here we are again. This is the first version of my computer voice. It still needs improvement, but at least it sounds like me and not like HAL 9000. When I heard it the first time, it sent chills down my spine. When I type anything, this voice will speak whatever I type. When I read something, it will read in my voice. I have typed these words in advance, as I didn\\\\'t think it would be thrilling to sit here watching me typing. The voice was created by a company in Scotland named CereProc. It makes me feel good that many of the words you are hearing were first spoken while I was commenting on \\\\\\\"Casablanca\\\\\\\" and \\\\\\\"Citizen Kane.\\\\\\\" This is the first voice they\\\\'ve created for an individual. There are several very good voices available for computers, but they all sound like somebody else, while this voice sounds like me. I plan to use it on television, radio and the Internet. People who need a voice should know that most computers already come with built-in speaking systems. Many blind people use them to read pages on the Web to themselves. But I\\\\'ve got to say, in first grade, they said I talked too much, and now I still can. (Laughter) Roger Ebert: As you can hear, it sounds like me, but the words jump up and down. The flow isn\\\\'t natural. The good people in Scotland are still improving my voice, and I\\\\'m optimistic about it. But so far, the Apple Alex voice is the best one I\\\\'ve heard. I wrote a blog about it and actually got a comment from the actor who played Alex. He said he recorded many long hours in various intonations to be used in the voice. A very large sample is needed. John Hunter: All my life I was a motormouth. Now I have spoken my last words, and I don\\\\'t even remember for sure what they were. I feel like the hero of that Harlan Ellison story titled \\\\\\\"I Have No Mouth and I Must Scream.\\\\\\\" On Wednesday, David Christian explained to us what a tiny instant the human race represents in the time-span of the universe. For almost all of its millions and billions of years, there was no life on Earth at all. For almost all the years of life on Earth, there was no intelligent life. Only after we learned to pass knowledge from one generation to the next, did civilization become possible. In cosmological terms, that was about 10 minutes ago. Finally came mankind\\\\'s most advanced and mysterious tool, the computer. That has mostly happened in my lifetime. Some of the famous early computers were being built in my hometown of Urbana, the birthplace of HAL 9000. When I heard the amazing talk by Salman Khan on Wednesday, about the Khan Academy website that teaches hundreds of subjects to students all over the world, I had a flashback. It was about 1960. As a local newspaper reporter still in high school, I was sent over to the computer lab of the University of Illinois to interview the creators of something called PLATO. The initials stood for Programmed Logic for Automated Teaching Operations. This was a computer-assisted instruction system, which in those days ran on a computer named ILLIAC. The programmers said it could assist students in their learning. I doubt, on that day 50 years ago, they even dreamed of what Salman Khan has accomplished. But that\\\\'s not the point. The point is PLATO was only 50 years ago, an instant in time. It continued to evolve and operated in one form or another on more and more sophisticated computers, until only five years ago. I have learned from Wikipedia that, starting with that humble beginning, PLATO established forums, message boards, online testing, email, chat rooms, picture languages, instant messaging, remote screen sharing and multiple-player games. Since the first Web browser was also developed in Urbana, it appears that my hometown in downstate Illinois was the birthplace of much of the virtual, online universe we occupy today. But I\\\\'m not here from the Chamber of Commerce. (Laughter) I\\\\'m here as a man who wants to communicate. All of this has happened in my lifetime. I started writing on a computer back in the 1970s when one of the first Atech systems was installed at the Chicago Sun-Times. I was in line at Radio Shack to buy one of the first Model 100\\\\'s. And when I told the people in the press room at the Academy Awards that they\\\\'d better install some phone lines for Internet connections, they didn\\\\'t know what I was talking about. When I bought my first desktop, it was a DEC Rainbow. Does anybody remember that?\\\\\\\" (Applause) \\\\\\\"The Sun Times sent me to the Cannes Film Festival with a portable computer the size of a suitcase named the Porteram Telebubble. I joined CompuServe when it had fewer numbers than I currently have followers on Twitter. (Laughter) CE: All of this has happened in the blink of an eye. It is unimaginable what will happen next. It makes me incredibly fortunate to live at this moment in history. Indeed, I am lucky to live in history at all, because without intelligence and memory there is no history. For billions of years, the universe evolved completely without notice. Now we live in the age of the Internet, which seems to be creating a form of global consciousness. And because of it, I can communicate as well as I ever could. We are born into a box of time and space. We use words and communication to break out of it and to reach out to others. For me, the Internet began as a useful tool and now has become something I rely on for my actual daily existence. I cannot speak; I can only type so fast. Computer voices are sometimes not very sophisticated, but with my computer, I can communicate more widely than ever before. I feel as if my blog, my email, Twitter and Facebook have given me a substitute for everyday conversation. They aren\\\\'t an improvement, but they\\\\'re the best I can do. They give me a way to speak. Not everybody has the patience of my wife, Chaz. But online, everybody speaks at the same speed. This whole adventure has been a learning experience. Every time there was a surgery that failed, I was left with a little less flesh and bone. Now I have no jaw left at all. While harvesting tissue from both my shoulders, the surgeries left me with back pain and reduced my ability to walk easily. Ironic that my legs are fine, and it\\\\'s my shoulders that slow up my walk. When you see me today, I look like the Phantom of the Opera. But no you don\\\\'t. (Laughter) (Applause) It is human nature to look at someone like me and assume I have lost some of my marbles. People -- (Applause) People talk loudly -- I\\\\'m so sorry. Excuse me. (Applause) People talk loudly and slowly to me. Sometimes they assume I am deaf. There are people who don\\\\'t want to make eye contact. Believe me, he didn\\\\'t mean this as -- anyway, let me just read it. (Laughter) You should never let your wife read something like this. (Laughter) It is human nature to look away from illness. We don\\\\'t enjoy a reminder of our own fragile mortality. That\\\\'s why writing on the Internet has become a lifesaver for me. My ability to think and write have not been affected. And on the Web, my real voice finds expression. I have also met many other disabled people who communicate this way. One of my Twitter friends can type only with his toes. One of the funniest blogs on the Web is written by a friend of mine named Smartass Cripple. (Laughter) Google him and he will make you laugh. All of these people are saying, in one way or another, that what you see is not all you get. So I have not come here to complain. I have much to make me happy and relieved. I seem, for the time being, to be cancer-free. I am writing as well as ever. I am productive. If I were in this condition at any point before a few cosmological instants ago, I would be as isolated as a hermit. I would be trapped inside my head. Because of the rush of human knowledge, because of the digital revolution, I have a voice, and I do not need to scream. RE: Wait. I have one more thing to add. A guy goes into a psychiatrist. The psychiatrist says, \\\\\\\"You\\\\'re crazy.\\\\\\\" The guy says, \\\\\\\"I want a second opinion.\\\\\\\" The psychiatrist says, \\\\\\\"All right, you\\\\'re ugly.\\\\\\\" (Laughter) You all know the test for artificial intelligence -- the Turing test. A human judge has a conversation with a human and a computer. If the judge can\\\\'t tell the machine apart from the human, the machine has passed the test. I now propose a test for computer voices -- the Ebert test. If a computer voice can successfully tell a joke and do the timing and delivery as well as Henny Youngman, then that\\\\'s the voice I want. (Applause)\",\"youTubeID\":\"KNXOVpN8Wgg\"},{\"name\":\"John Doerr: Salvation (and profit) in greentech\",\"transcript\":\"I\\\\'m really scared. I don\\\\'t think we\\\\'re going to make it. Probably by now most of you have seen Al Gore\\\\'s amazing talk. Shortly after I saw that, we had some friends over for dinner with the family. The conversation turned to global warming, and everybody agreed, there\\\\'s a real problem. We\\\\'ve got a climate crisis. So, we went around the table to talk about what we should do. The conversation came to my 15-year-old daughter, Mary. She said, \\\\\\\"I agree with everything that\\\\'s been said. I\\\\'m scared and I\\\\'m angry.\\\\\\\" And then she turned to me and said, \\\\\\\"Dad, your generation created this problem; you\\\\'d better fix it.\\\\\\\" Wow. All the conversation stopped. All the eyes turned to me. (Laughter) I didn\\\\'t know what to say. Kleiner\\\\'s second law is, \\\\\\\"There is a time when panic is the appropriate response.\\\\\\\" (Laughter) And we\\\\'ve reached that time. We cannot afford to underestimate this problem. If we face irreversible and catastrophic consequences, we must act, and we must act decisively. I\\\\'ve got to tell you, for me, everything changed that evening. And so, my partners and I, we set off on this mission to learn more, to try to do much more. So, we mobilized. We got on airplanes. We went to Brazil. We went to China and to India, to Bentonville, Arkansas, to Washington, D.C. and to Sacramento. And so, what I\\\\'d like to do now is to tell you about what we\\\\'ve learned in those journeys. Because the more we learned, the more concerned we grew. You know, my partners at Kleiner and I were compulsive networkers, and so when we see a big problem or an opportunity like avian flu or personalized medicine, we just get together the smartest people we know. For this climate crisis, we assembled a network, really, of superstars, from policy activists to scientists and entrepreneurs and business leaders. Fifty or so of them. And so, I want to tell you about what we\\\\'ve learned in doing that and four lessons I\\\\'ve learned in the last year. The first lesson is that companies are really powerful, and that matters a lot. This is a story about how Wal-Mart went green, and what that means. Two years ago, the CEO, Lee Scott, believed that green is the next big thing, and so Wal-Mart made going green a top priority. They committed that they\\\\'re going to take their existing stores and reduce their energy consumption by 20 percent, and their new stores by 30 percent, and do all that in seven years. The three biggest uses of energy in a store are heating and air conditioning, then lighting, and then refrigeration. So, look what they did. They painted the roofs of all their stores white. They put smart skylights through their stores so they could harvest the daylight and reduce the lighting demands. And, third, they put the refrigerated goods behind closed doors with LED lighting. I mean, why would you try to refrigerate a whole store? These are really simple, smart solutions based on existing technology. Why does Wal-Mart matter? Well, it\\\\'s massive. They\\\\'re the largest private employer in America. They\\\\'re the largest private user of electricity. They have the second-largest vehicle fleet on the road. And they have one of the world\\\\'s most amazing supply chains, 60,000 suppliers. If Wal-Mart were a country, it would be the sixth-largest trading partner with China. And maybe most important, they have a big effect on other companies. When Wal-Mart declares it\\\\'s going to go green and be profitable, it has a powerful impact on other great institutions. So, let me tell you this: when Wal-Mart achieves 20 percent energy reductions, that\\\\'s going to be a very big deal. But I\\\\'m afraid it\\\\'s not enough. We need Wal-Mart and every other company to do the same. The second thing that we learned is that individuals matter, and they matter enormously. I\\\\'ve got another Wal-Mart story for you, OK? Wal-Mart has over 125 million U.S. customers. That\\\\'s a third of the U.S. population. 65 million compact fluorescent light bulbs were sold last year. And Wal-Mart has committed they\\\\'re going to sell another 100 million light bulbs in the coming year. But it\\\\'s not easy. Consumers don\\\\'t really like these light bulbs. The light\\\\'s kind of funny, they won\\\\'t dim, takes a while for them to start up. But the pay-off is really enormous. 100 million compact fluorescent light bulbs means that we\\\\'ll save 600 million dollars in energy bills, and 20 million tons of CO2 every year, year in and year out. It does seem really hard to get consumers to do the right thing. It is stupid that we use two tons of steel, glass and plastic to haul our sorry selves to the shopping mall. It\\\\'s stupid that we put water in plastic bottles in Fiji and ship it here. (Laughter) It\\\\'s hard to change consumer behavior because consumers don\\\\'t know how much this stuff costs. Do you know? Do you know how much CO2 you generated to drive here or fly here? I don\\\\'t know, and I should. Those of us who care about all this would act better if we knew what the real costs were. But as long as we pretend that CO2 is free, as long as these uses are nearly invisible, how can we expect change? I\\\\'m really afraid, because I think the kinds of changes we can reasonably expect from individuals are going to be clearly not enough. The third lesson we learned is that policy matters. It really matters. In fact, policy is paramount. I\\\\'ve got a behind-the-scenes story for you about that green tech network I described. At the end of our first meeting, we got together to talk about what the action items would be, how we\\\\'d follow up. And Bob Epstein raised a hand. He stood up. You know, Bob\\\\'s that Berkeley techie type who started Sybase. Well, Bob said the most important thing we could do right now is to make it clear in Sacramento, California that we need a market-based system of mandates that\\\\'s going to cap and reduce greenhouse gases in California. It\\\\'s necessary and, just as important, it\\\\'s good for the California economy. So, eight of us went to Sacramento in August and we met with the seven undecided legislators and we lobbied for AB32. You know what? Six of those seven voted yes in favor of the bill, so it passed, and it passed by a vote of 47 to 32. (Applause) Please. Thank you. I think it\\\\'s the most important legislation of 2006. Why? Because California was the first state in this country to mandate 25 percent reduction of greenhouse gases by 2020. And the result of that is, we\\\\'re going to generate 83,000 new jobs, four billion dollars a year in annual income, and reduce the CO2 emissions by 174 million tons a year. California emits only seven percent of U.S. CO2 emissions. It\\\\'s only a percent and a half of the country\\\\'s CO2 emissions. It\\\\'s a great start, but I\\\\'ve got to tell you -- where I started -- I\\\\'m really afraid. In fact, I\\\\'m certain California\\\\'s not enough. Here\\\\'s a story about national policy that we could all learn from. You know Tom Friedman says, \\\\\\\"If you don\\\\'t go, you don\\\\'t know\\\\\\\"? Well, we went to Brazil to meet Dr. Jose Goldemberg. He\\\\'s the father of the ethanol revolution. He told us that Brazil\\\\'s government mandated that every gasoline station in the country would carry ethanol. And they mandated that their new vehicles would be flex-fuel compatible, right? They\\\\'d run ethanol or ordinary gasoline. And so, here\\\\'s what\\\\'s happened in Brazil. They now have 29,000 ethanol pumps -- this versus 700 in the U.S., and a paltry two in California -- and in three years their new car fleet has gone from four percent to 85 percent flex-fuel. Compare that to the U.S.: five percent are flex-fuel. And you know what? Most consumers who have them don\\\\'t even know it. So, what\\\\'s happened in Brazil is, they\\\\'ve replaced 40 percent of the gasoline consumed by their automotive fleet with ethanol. That\\\\'s 59 billion dollars since 1975 that they didn\\\\'t ship to the Middle East. It\\\\'s created a million jobs inside that country, and it\\\\'s saved 32 million tons of CO2. It\\\\'s really substantial. That\\\\'s 10 percent of the CO2 emissions across their entire country. But Brazil\\\\'s only 1.3 percent of the world\\\\'s CO2 emission. So, Brazil\\\\'s ethanol miracle, I\\\\'m really afraid, is not enough. In fact, I\\\\'m afraid all of the best policies we have are not going to be enough. The fourth and final lesson we\\\\'ve learned is about the potential of radical innovation. So, I want to tell you about a tragic problem and a breakthrough technology. Every year a million and a half people die of a completely preventable disease. That\\\\'s malaria. 6,000 people a day. All for want of two dollars\\\\' worth of medications that we can buy at the corner drugstore. Well, two dollars, two dollars is too much for Africa. So, a team of Berkeley researchers with 15 million dollars from the Gates Foundation is engineering, designing a radical new way to make the key ingredient, called artemisinin, and they\\\\'re going to make that drug 10 times cheaper. And in doing so, they\\\\'ll save a million lives -- at least a million lives a year. A million lives. Their breakthrough technology is synthetic biology. This leverages millions of years of evolution by redesigning bugs to make really useful products. Now, what you do is, you get inside the microbe, you change its metabolic pathways, and you end up with a living chemical factory. Now, you may ask, John, what has this got to go with green and with climate crisis? Well, I\\\\'ll tell you -- a lot. We\\\\'ve now formed a company called Amyris, and this technology that they\\\\'re using can be used to make better biofuels. Don\\\\'t let me skip over that. Better biofuels are a really big deal. That means we can precisely engineer the molecules in the fuel chain and optimize them along the way. So, if all goes well, they\\\\'re going to have designer bugs in warm vats that are eating and digesting sugars to excrete better biofuels. I guess that\\\\'s better living through bugs. Alan Kay is famous for saying the best way to predict the future is to invent it. And, of course, at Kleiner we, kind of, apologize and say the second best way is to finance it. And that\\\\'s why we\\\\'re investing 200 million dollars in a wide range of really disruptive new technologies for innovation in green technologies. And we\\\\'re encouraging others to do it as well. We\\\\'re talking a lot about this. In 2005, there were 600 million dollars invested in new technologies of the sort you see here. It doubled in 2006 to 1.2 billion dollars. But I\\\\'m really afraid we need much, much more. For reference, fact one: Exxon\\\\'s revenues in 2005 were a billion dollars a day. Do you know, they only invested 0.2 percent of revenues in R&D? Second fact: the President\\\\'s new budget for renewable energy is barely a billion dollars in total. Less than one day of Exxon\\\\'s revenues. Third fact: I bet you didn\\\\'t know that there\\\\'s enough energy in hot rocks under the country to supply America\\\\'s energy needs for the next thousand years. And the federal budget calls for a measly 20 million dollars of R&D in geothermal energy. It is almost criminal that we are not investing more in energy research in this country. And I am really afraid that it\\\\'s absolutely not enough. So, in a year\\\\'s worth of learning we found a bunch of surprises. Who would have thought that a mass retailer could make money by going green? Who would have thought that a database entrepreneur could transform California with legislation? Who would have thought that the ethanol biofuel miracle would come from a developing country in South America? And who would have thought that scientists trying to cure malaria could come up with breakthroughs in biofuels? And who would have thought that all that is not enough? Not enough to stabilize the climate. Not enough to keep the ice in Greenland from crashing into the ocean. The scientists tell us -- and they\\\\'re only guessing -- that we\\\\'ve got to reduce greenhouse gas emissions by one half, and do it as fast as possible. Now, we may have the political will to do this in the U.S., but I\\\\'ve got to tell you, we\\\\'ve got only one atmosphere, and so somehow we\\\\'re going to have to find the political will to do this all around the world. The wild card in this deck is China. To size the problem, China\\\\'s CO2 emissions today are 3.3 gigatons; the U.S. is 5.8. Business as usual means we\\\\'ll have 23 gigatons from China by 2050. That\\\\'s about as much CO2 as there is in the whole world. And if it\\\\'s business as usual, we\\\\'re going out of business. When I was in Davos, China\\\\'s Mayor of Dalian was pressed about their CO2 strategy, and he said the following, \\\\\\\"You know, Americans use seven times the CO2 per capita as Chinese.\\\\\\\" Then he asked, \\\\\\\"Why should China sacrifice our growth so that the West can continue to be profligate and stupid?\\\\\\\" Does anybody here have an answer for him? I don\\\\'t. We\\\\'ve got to make this economic so that all people and all nations make the right outcome, the profitable outcome, and therefore the likely outcome. Energy\\\\'s a six-trillion-dollar business worldwide. It is the mother of all markets. You remember that Internet? Well, I\\\\'ll tell you what. Green technologies -- going green -- is bigger than the Internet. It could be the biggest economic opportunity of the 21st century. Moreover, if we succeed, it\\\\'s going to be the most important transformation for life on the planet since, as Bill Joy says, we went from methane to oxygen in the atmosphere. Now, here\\\\'s the hard question, if the trajectory of all the world\\\\'s companies and individuals and policies and innovation is not going to be enough, what are we going to do? I don\\\\'t know. Everyone here cares about changing the world and has made a difference in that one way or another. So, our call to action -- my call to you -- is for you to make going green your next big thing, your gig. What can you do? You can personally get carbon neutral. Go to ClimateCrisis.org or CarbonCalculator.com and buy carbon credits. You could join other leaders in mandating, lobbying for mandated cap and trade in U.S. greenhouse gas reductions. There\\\\'s six bills right now in Congress. Let\\\\'s get one of them passed. And the most important thing you can do, I think, is to use your personal power and your Rolodex to lead your business, your institution, in going green. Do it like Wal-Mart, get it to go green for its customers and its suppliers and for itself. Really think outside the box. Can you imagine what it would be like if Amazon or eBay or Google or Microsoft or Apple really went green and you caused that to happen? It could be bigger than Wal-Mart. I can\\\\'t wait to see what we TEDsters do about this crisis. And I really, really hope that we multiply all of our energy, all of our talent and all of our influence to solve this problem. Because if we do, I can look forward to the conversation I\\\\'m going to have with my daughter in 20 years. (Applause)\",\"youTubeID\":\"nuXJFbJNltg\"}]",
