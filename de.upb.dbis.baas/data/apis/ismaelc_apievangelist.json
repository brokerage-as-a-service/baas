These 4 methods make up the core functionality of many transactional web applications. The DAVE API aims to simplify and abstract may of the common tasks that these types of APIs require. DAVE does the work for you, and he's not CRUD. Dave was built to be both easy to use, but to be as simple as possible. I was tired of bloated frameworks that were designed to be monolithic applications which include M's, V's, and C's together in a single running application. As applications grow and become more 'service oriented', this is the eventual route which many applications go. I wanted to make is as simple as possible to create a new application with this mindset, and to allow for future flexibility.The DAVE API defines a single access point and accepts GET, POST, or COOKIE input. You define \\\"Action's\\\" that handle the input, such as \\\"AddUser\\\" or \\\"GeoLocate\\\". The DAVE API is NOT \\\"RESTful\\\", in that it does not use the normal verbs (Get, Put, etc) and uses a single /path/. This was chosen to make it as simple as possible for devices/users to access the functions, including low-level embedded devices which may have trouble with all the HTTP verbs. To see how simple it is to handle basic actions, this package comes with a basic user system included. Look in /Actions/examples to see the logic behind adding, editing, viewing, and deleting users. This includes log in. Restful paths are optional if you really must have them, and be defined per Action.The DAVE API understands 2 types of security methodology. \\\"Public\\\" actions can be called by anyone, and then can implement optional user-based security (checking userIDs and PasswordHashes?). Optionally, certain Actions can be defined as \\\"Private\\\", and will require a defined developer to authenticate with every request. This requires your developers to provide an MD5 hash of their APIKey and private DeveloperID to authenticate with. You can mix private and public actions. Of course, you can make your own actions for this as well!Dave contains an end-to-end API test suite for TDD, a Task model, an Active Database Model, and a stand-alone development server (written in just PHP) to get you started.\",\n      \"website\": \"https://github.com/evantahler/PHP-DAVE-API\",\n      \"logo\": \"http://kinlane-productions.s3.amazonaws.com/api-evangelist-site/tools/github-logo.png\",\n      \"tags\": \"API Deployment,Framework,PHP\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"id\": \"5\",\n      \"name\": \"Django Rest\",\n      \"summary\": \"Django REST framework is a lightweight REST framework for Django, that aims to make it easy to build well-connected, self-describing RESTful Web APIs.Features Include:\\n\\nAutomatically provides an awesome Django admin style browse-able self-documenting API.\\nClean, simple, views for Resources, using Django&rsquo;s new class based views.\\nSupport for ModelResources with out-of-the-box default implement\",\n      \"details\": \"Django REST framework is a lightweight REST framework for Django, that aims to make it easy to build well-connected, self-describing RESTful Web APIs.Features Include:\\n\\nAutomatically provides an awesome Django admin style browse-able self-documenting API.\\nClean, simple, views for Resources, using Django&rsquo;s new class based views.\\nSupport for ModelResources with out-of-the-box default implementations and input validation.\\nPluggable parsers, renderers, authentication and permissions - Easy to customise.\\nContent type negotiation using HTTP Accept headers.\\nOptional support for forms as input validation.\\nModular architecture - MixIn classes can be used without requiring the Resource or ModelResource classes.\\n\",\n      \"website\": \"http://django-rest-framework.org/\",\n      \"logo\": \"http://kinlane-productions.s3.amazonaws.com/api-evangelist-site/tools/Django-REST-Framework-Logo.png\",\n      \"tags\": \"API Deployment,Django,Framework,Python\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"id\": \"2\",\n      \"name\": \"Epiphany\",\n      \"summary\": \"The Epiphany framework is fast, easy, clean and RESTful.

These 4 methods make up the core functionality of many transactional web applications. The DAVE API aims to simplify and abstract may of the common tasks that these types of APIs require. DAVE does the work for you, and he's not CRUD. Dave was built to be both easy to use, but to be as simple as possible. I was tired of bloated frameworks that were designed to be monolithic applications which include M's, V's, and C's together in a single running application. As applications grow and become more 'service oriented', this is the eventual route which many applications go. I wanted to make is as simple as possible to create a new application with this mindset, and to allow for future flexibility.The DAVE API defines a single access point and accepts GET, POST, or COOKIE input. You define \\\"Action's\\\" that handle the input, such as \\\"AddUser\\\" or \\\"GeoLocate\\\". The DAVE API is NOT \\\"RESTful\\\", in that it does not use the normal verbs (Get, Put, etc) and uses a single /path/. This was chosen to make it as simple as possible for devices/users to access the functions, including low-level embedded devices which may have trouble with all the HTTP verbs. To see how simple it is to handle basic actions, this package comes with a basic user system included. Look in /Actions/examples to see the logic behind adding, editing, viewing, and deleting users. This includes log in. Restful paths are optional if you really must have them, and be defined per Action.The DAVE API understands 2 types of security methodology. \\\"Public\\\" actions can be called by anyone, and then can implement optional user-based security (checking userIDs and PasswordHashes?). Optionally, certain Actions can be defined as \\\"Private\\\", and will require a defined developer to authenticate with every request. This requires your developers to provide an MD5 hash of their APIKey and private DeveloperID to authenticate with. You can mix private and public actions. Of course, you can make your own actions for this as well!Dave contains an end-to-end API test suite for TDD, a Task model, an Active Database Model, and a stand-alone development server (written in just PHP) to get you started.\",\n      \"website\": \"https://github.com/evantahler/PHP-DAVE-API\",\n      \"logo\": \"http://kinlane-productions.s3.amazonaws.com/api-evangelist-site/tools/github-logo.png\",\n      \"tags\": \"API Deployment,Framework,PHP\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"id\": \"5\",\n      \"name\": \"Django Rest\",\n      \"summary\": \"Django REST framework is a lightweight REST framework for Django, that aims to make it easy to build well-connected, self-describing RESTful Web APIs.Features Include:\\n\\nAutomatically provides an awesome Django admin style browse-able self-documenting API.\\nClean, simple, views for Resources, using Django&rsquo;s new class based views.\\nSupport for ModelResources with out-of-the-box default implement\",\n      \"details\": \"Django REST framework is a lightweight REST framework for Django, that aims to make it easy to build well-connected, self-describing RESTful Web APIs.Features Include:\\n\\nAutomatically provides an awesome Django admin style browse-able self-documenting API.\\nClean, simple, views for Resources, using Django&rsquo;s new class based views.\\nSupport for ModelResources with out-of-the-box default implementations and input validation.\\nPluggable parsers, renderers, authentication and permissions - Easy to customise.\\nContent type negotiation using HTTP Accept headers.\\nOptional support for forms as input validation.\\nModular architecture - MixIn classes can be used without requiring the Resource or ModelResource classes.\\n\",\n      \"website\": \"http://django-rest-framework.org/\",\n      \"logo\": \"http://kinlane-productions.s3.amazonaws.com/api-evangelist-site/tools/Django-REST-Framework-Logo.png\",\n      \"tags\": \"API Deployment,Django,Framework,Python\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"id\": \"2\",\n      \"name\": \"Epiphany\",\n      \"summary\": \"The Epiphany framework is fast, easy, clean and RESTful.
