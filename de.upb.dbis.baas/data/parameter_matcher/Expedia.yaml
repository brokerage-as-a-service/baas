        Search property content for active properties in the requested language. <br><br>

        When searching with query parameter, `property_id`, you may request 1 to 250 properties at a time.<br><br>

        When searching with query parameters other than `property_id`, the response will be paginated. The response will contain a header, `Link`. The `Link` header contains a single URL to get the immediate next page of results, and follows the [IETF standard](https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc5988). The URL in the `Link` header will contain a `token` query string parameter, which is a value generated by the API. To get the next page of results, simply follow the `next` URL in the `Link` header without modifying it. When no `Link` header is returned with an empty body and a 200 response code, the pagination has completed.<br>

          * Example: `<https://api.ean.com/2.2/properties/content?token=MY5S3j36cOcLfLBZjPYQ1abhfc8CqmjmFVzkk7euvWaunE57LLeDgaxm516m>; rel="next"`<br><br>

          The response is a JSON map where the key is the property ID and the value is the property object itself, which can include property-level, room-level and rate-level information.

        in: header
        description: |
          IP address of the customer, as captured by your integration. Send IPV4 addresses only.<br>
          Ensure your integration passes the customer's IP, not your own. This value helps determine their location and assign the correct payment gateway.<br>
          Also used for fraud recovery and other important analytics.
        required: true
        schema:

          Insert your own unique value for each user session, beginning with the first API call.
          Continue to pass the same value for each subsequent API call during the user's session, using a new value for every new customer session.<br>
          Including this value greatly eases EPS's internal debugging process for issues with partner requests, as it explicitly links together request paths for individual user's session.

      summary: Regions
      description: |
        Returns the geographic definition and property mappings of regions matching the specified parameters.<br><br>

        To request all regions in the world, omit the `ancestor` query parameter. To request all regions in a specific continent, country or other level, specify the ID of that region as the `ancestor`. Refer to the list of [top level regions](https://developer.expediapartnersolutions.com/reference/geography-reference-lists-2-2/).<br><br>

        The response is a paginated list of regions. The response will contain a header, `Link`. The `Link` header contains a single URL to get the immediate next page of results, and follows the [IETF standard](https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc5988). To get the next page of results, simply follow the `next` URL in the `Link` header without modifying it. When no `Link` header is returned with an empty body and a 200 response code, the pagination has completed. If the link expires, there will be an `expires` link-extension that is the UTC date the link will expire, in ISO 8601 format.<br>

        * Example: `<https://api.ean.com/2.2/regions?token=DXF1ZXJ5QW5kRmV0Y2gBAAAAAAdcoBgWbUpHYTdsdFVRc2U4c0xfLUhGMzM1QQ>; rel="next"; expires="2019-03-05T07:23:14.000Z"`

      summary: Region Descendants
      description: |
        Returns the geographic definition and property mappings of all hierarchical descendants for the requested Region ID. To request all regions in the world, specify the Region ID of 0 (zero). To request all regions in a specific continent, country or other level, specify the Region ID of that region. Refer to the list of [top level regions](https://developer.expediapartnersolutions.com/reference/geography-reference-lists-2-2/).
        <br>The response is a JSON stream of a map, where the key is a region type and the value is another map. That additional map contains the Region ID as the key, and the region object as the value. Neither map has any order.
        <br>The response can be very large. We recommend saving the streamed response to a file on disk rather than keeping the whole response in memory.

      summary: Properties within Polygon
      description: |
        Returns the properties within an custom polygon that represents a multi-city area or smaller.
        The coordinates of the polygon should be in [GeoJSON format](https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc7946) and the polygon must conform to the following restrictions:
          * Polygon size - diagonal distance of the polygon must be less than 500km
          * Polygon type - only single polygons are supported
          * Number of coordinates - must be <= 2000

          Including this value greatly eases EPS's internal debugging process for issues with partner requests, as it explicitly links together request paths for individual user's session.

        Confirms the price returned by the Shop response. Use this API to verify a previously-selected rate is still valid before booking. If the price is matched, the response returns a link to request a booking. If the price has changed, the response returns new price details and a booking link for the new price. If the rate is no longer available, the response will return a new shop request link to search again for different rates. In the event of a price change, go back to shop and book the property at the new price or return to additional rates for the property.

      description: |
        This API call returns itinerary details and links to resume or cancel the booking. There are two methods to retrieve a booking:
        * Using the link included in the original Book response, example: https://api.ean.com/2.2/itineraries/8955599932111?token=QldfCGlcUA4GXVlSAQ4W
        * Using the email of the booking, example: https://api.ean.com/2.2/itineraries/8955599932111?email=customer@email.com

          Including this value greatly eases EPS's internal debugging process for issues with partner requests, as it explicitly links together request paths for individual user's session.
